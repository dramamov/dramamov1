00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:16.224
{\an8}Thanks for the meal.

00:00:16.307 --> 00:00:18.601
Thank you!

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:20.562
Come again!

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:49.174
Wow. It's rare to see you take those out.

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:53.553
Finally ready to
start earning some living expenses?

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:04.022
You're scaring me now.

00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:09.360
This is alarming.

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:13.865
Even if you stab him with this,
you wouldn't be able to kill him.

00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:16.409
That man is not a superstar.

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:19.329
He's just a piece of shit.

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:45.897
So she can kill him…

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:23.476
Wow, it's so pretty!

00:02:24.352 --> 00:02:26.187
Nice view, right?

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.314
I like this place.

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:41.035
My heart feels lighter when
I stare out into space here.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.377
DEAR CUSTOMER, READ THIS IMMEDIATELY

00:03:34.672 --> 00:03:37.717
You're Asuka Kunimi. Is that right?

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:39.677
Yes?

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:45.725
I'm Osanai from Kanagoma Realty.
We manage this apartment building.

00:03:45.808 --> 00:03:50.563
You owe us three months' rent
and the renewal fees.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:55.235
The total amount overdue is 352,000 yen.

00:03:55.318 --> 00:04:00.740
If you cannot pay by next weekend,
we have to ask you to vacate immediately.

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:02.700
What?

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:07.080
- Ah…
- Yes.

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:10.333
By the way, this is your final notice.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.419
- Okay…
- Thank you. Goodbye.

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:40.530
Hey, Ms. Kunimi. Can we talk?

00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:42.699
Yes.

00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:50.540
Ms. Kunimi,
how long have you been working with us?

00:04:53.334 --> 00:04:55.086
A little over three years.

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:56.379
Right.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.048
Do you enjoy your work?

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:03.720
Is this about the contract renewal?

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:10.518
I have to say,
you're quite perceptive at times.

00:05:15.606 --> 00:05:22.030
So, lately our company
is really struggling.

00:05:23.364 --> 00:05:27.368
Looks like we may not be able to
renew everyone's contract…

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:29.787
So you're firing me?

00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:32.915
Oh, no, let's not use such a word.

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.916
But, yeah…

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:39.839
That's too abrupt.
I can't accept it. I need money now.

00:05:40.798 --> 00:05:46.596
Well you know,
you never seemed to fit in right?

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:51.976
Taking that into consideration,
this might be the best.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.837
Is that from the day of Dad's Ho-oh Match?

00:06:23.382 --> 00:06:28.221
Poor Dad. Chased by a psycho.

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:31.390
Did they catch her?

00:06:32.975 --> 00:06:33.935
No.

00:06:34.435 --> 00:06:35.686
Called the police?

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:38.314
Why not?

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:44.862
I've told you,

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:48.533
your dad used to be
married to someone else.

00:06:48.616 --> 00:06:49.492
Yeah.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.623
This girl's name is Asuka Kunimi.

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:57.500
Kunimi?

00:06:57.583 --> 00:06:59.544
She's your sister.

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:06.425
I see.

00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:10.972
Are you telling Dad?

00:07:15.184 --> 00:07:16.185
Think I'll tell him?

00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:46.299
What is it?

00:07:47.508 --> 00:07:50.178
I'm in charge of this area.

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:56.434
You're not supposed to
go in there when cleaning.

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:03.024
I'm sorry! I messed up! I'm so sorry!

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:27.965
Hey, you're on shift today.
Weeknights aren't usually busy.

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:29.425
On shift?

00:08:30.134 --> 00:08:32.929
I told you. I have plans tonight.

00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:38.643
REGARDING ASUKA KUNIMI

00:08:38.726 --> 00:08:41.270
Hey, Seigo?

00:08:42.438 --> 00:08:43.272
Hey.

00:08:45.441 --> 00:08:48.444
Hey, wait a sec. Where are you going?

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:54.617
What? I'm going to kill the old era.

00:08:58.329 --> 00:08:59.539
What?!

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:06.128
Good work today.

00:09:13.135 --> 00:09:15.638
Ms. Kunimi! Come with me.

00:09:29.151 --> 00:09:34.198
Actually, there was a theft
on the floor you were in charge of.

00:09:35.032 --> 00:09:38.077
Some of our staff's wallets
have gone missing.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.204
So you think I did it?

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:47.837
Ms. Kunimi. I'm sorry,
but just in case, could we check your bag?

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:52.925
- I didn't do it. It's not me.
- Your bag. Can we?

00:10:10.234 --> 00:10:12.737
What? No! I don't know what's going on!

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.448
- Then what's this?
- I don't know! I didn't do it!

00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:16.949
- Somebody--
- Someone else?

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:20.745
You're saying somebody put these
in your bag? For what?

00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:35.134
What?

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:44.644
Money trouble, huh?

00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:47.813
I didn't do it. Someone framed me.

00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:52.276
But, the wallets were found in your bag.

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:55.780
I didn't do it.

00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:00.034
You've got a family?

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:03.287
I have no family.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.206
Nobody?

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.627
My mother just passed away.

00:11:11.504 --> 00:11:12.797
And your father?

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.220
I don't have a father.

00:11:30.731 --> 00:11:32.858
Yuna, you take that seat.

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:34.026
Thank you.

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:39.740
Whoa, looks good.

00:11:44.078 --> 00:11:45.621
Oh, where's Dad?

00:11:45.704 --> 00:11:47.164
In his room.

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:50.251
What is he doing? Making Yuna wait…

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:03.722
I watched the last
Joryu Kisho Title Match.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.809
Your comeback win was impressive.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:09.812
Thank you so much.

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:13.774
When are you getting married?

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:18.654
Tatsuya and I have been discussing it.
Sooner, rather than later.

00:12:19.655 --> 00:12:22.616
I see. That's exciting.

00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:24.160
Yes.

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:27.455
So, that means

00:12:28.789 --> 00:12:30.499
no more shogi for you.

00:12:31.667 --> 00:12:32.501
Pardon?

00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:35.838
You'll quit after marriage, won't you?

00:12:36.714 --> 00:12:38.424
No, that's not our plan--

00:12:38.507 --> 00:12:39.800
Yuna.

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:43.929
You are a joryu kishi.

00:12:45.139 --> 00:12:46.015
Yes?

00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:50.311
A female professional shogi player
is not a real kishi.

00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:54.857
We don't need women
to play shogi in this family.

00:12:55.524 --> 00:12:58.319
Serve the Yuuki family.

00:13:00.154 --> 00:13:03.491
That will be the
purpose of your life from now on.

00:13:10.372 --> 00:13:11.373
Yes.

00:13:32.686 --> 00:13:36.357
I told you, Yuna will be coming today.

00:13:46.367 --> 00:13:48.285
Something else you need to say?

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:53.791
Whatever.

00:13:58.587 --> 00:14:00.214
Madam, a call for you.

00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:06.512
Speaking.

00:14:11.433 --> 00:14:12.560
What?

00:14:26.448 --> 00:14:27.491
Come with me.

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:30.536
Your relative is here for you.

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:33.664
My relative?

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.703
Nice to meet you, Asuka Kunimi.

00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:15.205
I'm Tatsuya Yuuki.

00:15:18.375 --> 00:15:19.627
Yuuki?

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:20.628
Yes.

00:15:21.211 --> 00:15:23.631
I'm Shoichi Yuuki's son,

00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:27.217
and your younger brother.

00:15:30.679 --> 00:15:31.847
Why are you here?

00:15:32.806 --> 00:15:37.353
My mother is quite well-connected
so the police contacted her.

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:39.396
I came to rescue you.

00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:42.733
Rescue me?

00:15:42.816 --> 00:15:43.984
Yes.

00:15:44.068 --> 00:15:48.697
You were really desperate, weren't you?
Stealing wallets?

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.578
I didn't do it.

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:56.664
There's too much evidence though.

00:15:56.747 --> 00:15:59.625
At this rate, you'll surely be indicted.

00:16:00.376 --> 00:16:03.462
Police and prosecutors have quotas.

00:16:03.545 --> 00:16:07.049
If you have no backup,
they'd press charges to earn points.

00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:10.928
You can't afford a good lawyer
and have no family to rely on.

00:16:12.012 --> 00:16:14.390
You're such an easy target.

00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:20.354
That said, justice is all about
games and negotiation.

00:16:25.776 --> 00:16:29.863
I assure you that
I can bail you out right away.

00:16:31.782 --> 00:16:32.866
But…

00:16:34.201 --> 00:16:36.370
There's one condition.

00:16:37.705 --> 00:16:38.872
Condition?

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:40.416
Yes.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.921
I'd like you to sign this.

00:16:59.727 --> 00:17:02.354
1. I WILL NOT APPROACH SHOICHI YUUKI
AND HIS FAMILY…

00:17:02.438 --> 00:17:04.481
2. I WILL NOT REVEAL MY BLOOD RELATION…

00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:06.692
Stay away from my father,

00:17:06.775 --> 00:17:09.278
and by extension, the Yuuki family.

00:17:09.361 --> 00:17:11.697
Don't be a nuisance to us.

00:17:13.782 --> 00:17:16.076
This oath is to promise all of that.

00:17:32.926 --> 00:17:35.137
How do you like the taste of freedom?

00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:46.023
Here, it's your copy.

00:17:56.867 --> 00:17:58.994
Well, shall we?

00:18:17.846 --> 00:18:18.889
Good for you.

00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:21.642
What?

00:18:22.851 --> 00:18:26.021
The security cameras caught the thief.

00:18:26.897 --> 00:18:28.732
A woman from a cleaning company.

00:18:29.441 --> 00:18:33.153
She's been hopping cleaning jobs,
probably a habitual offender.

00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:38.492
Sorry for detaining you for so long.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.757
You said I'll surely be indicted.

00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:57.386
I told you. It's all games.

00:18:58.512 --> 00:19:00.597
With that, my work here is done.

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:31.503
I'm sorry but,

00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:35.507
you need to give up on your revenge.

00:19:37.718 --> 00:19:40.470
Don't keep fighting a losing game.

00:19:40.554 --> 00:19:42.222
It's hard to watch.

00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:46.935
You wouldn't understand!

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:48.312
I do.

00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:54.193
I understand you're here as you are
because of the choices you've made.

00:19:55.402 --> 00:19:58.947
You have chosen the poor, pathetic life.

00:19:59.656 --> 00:20:01.867
You and your mother.

00:20:06.622 --> 00:20:07.873
Take this.

00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:12.211
My condolences.

00:21:15.274 --> 00:21:17.859
Why didn't you use the footage?

00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:20.237
That would've silenced her.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.991
Why would I release
the perfect scandal material?

00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:26.952
Are you sure this is fine?
She tried to kill Dad.

00:21:27.035 --> 00:21:28.203
That's why,

00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:30.372
we must watch her.

00:21:31.081 --> 00:21:32.291
Who'll do that?

00:21:33.041 --> 00:21:34.459
You know who.

00:21:36.753 --> 00:21:39.089
You work me so hard.

00:21:52.227 --> 00:21:57.190
KANAGOMA REALTY

00:21:57.274 --> 00:22:00.360
SHOICHI YUUKI

00:23:23.985 --> 00:23:28.406
My heart feels lighter when
I stare out into space here.

00:24:43.356 --> 00:24:46.151
Running away, Asuka Kunimi?

00:24:51.448 --> 00:24:52.490
So you are…

00:24:53.408 --> 00:24:55.744
Shoichi Yuuki's daughter.

00:24:57.704 --> 00:24:59.497
Don't glare at me.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.000
What do you want?

00:25:02.959 --> 00:25:04.336
You left this.

00:25:11.384 --> 00:25:12.886
I don't need it anymore.

00:25:12.969 --> 00:25:13.803
Why not?

00:25:13.887 --> 00:25:16.097
Aren't you going to stab him?

00:25:16.181 --> 00:25:18.141
You said that wouldn't kill him!

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.561
It's over anyway.

00:25:26.733 --> 00:25:28.693
Why do you hate your father?

00:25:32.822 --> 00:25:34.532
My entire life…

00:25:38.411 --> 00:25:40.372
was erased by him.

00:25:41.248 --> 00:25:44.292
TO MY BELOVED FAMILY:
MY WIFE KAORI AND MY SON TATSUYA

00:25:48.421 --> 00:25:50.799
He erased me and my mother.

00:25:51.675 --> 00:25:53.677
He denied our existence.

00:25:54.928 --> 00:25:58.431
So, I wanted to do the same.

00:25:59.224 --> 00:26:02.394
I wanted to erase him
and deny his entire life.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.651
But now…

00:26:11.486 --> 00:26:13.488
I'm too tired now.

00:26:18.159 --> 00:26:19.577
So, you're running away?

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:23.540
Pathetic.

00:26:26.835 --> 00:26:29.087
I'm also someone Shoichi Yuuki killed off.

00:26:32.173 --> 00:26:36.678
To kill someone
is to deny their entire life.

00:26:37.512 --> 00:26:39.931
For him, that's shogi.

00:26:41.349 --> 00:26:43.143
If you want to kill him,

00:26:44.936 --> 00:26:46.313
this won't help.

00:26:50.859 --> 00:26:52.193
Use this.

00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:55.071
ROOK

00:27:00.035 --> 00:27:01.828
I want to get my revenge.

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:06.333
Until then, I'll live no matter what.

00:27:07.751 --> 00:27:09.377
Aren't you the same?

00:27:12.297 --> 00:27:16.176
Let's team up, Asuka Kunimi.

00:27:22.432 --> 00:27:23.350
I…

00:27:24.726 --> 00:27:25.935
I'm done.

00:27:36.529 --> 00:27:38.281
You know…

00:27:38.365 --> 00:27:41.368
You've been up there for a while.
Are you going to jump?

00:27:42.243 --> 00:27:44.913
What do you want?
Are you going to kill yourself?

00:27:49.042 --> 00:27:50.460
Don't think you can.

00:27:50.543 --> 00:27:52.003
Why?!

00:27:53.505 --> 00:27:54.756
Because…

00:28:07.018 --> 00:28:08.603
You've got a job to do.

00:28:24.202 --> 00:28:25.245
What?!

00:28:28.415 --> 00:28:29.249
Wait…

00:28:42.679 --> 00:28:44.055
Are you okay?!

00:28:44.139 --> 00:28:46.516
Ouch, it hurts.

00:28:48.768 --> 00:28:50.645
See?

00:28:50.729 --> 00:28:52.105
I can't die.

00:28:53.106 --> 00:28:54.649
What kind of idiot are you?!

00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:55.942
You're the same.

00:28:58.611 --> 00:29:01.197
No matter how many times

00:29:02.532 --> 00:29:04.325
you get cornered or fall,

00:29:05.118 --> 00:29:07.370
you get back up and keep playing.

00:29:07.912 --> 00:29:10.039
That's shogi.

00:29:11.624 --> 00:29:13.418
I'm not going to die.

00:29:15.003 --> 00:29:16.713
You're not going to die.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.594
Your reason to live is right before you.

00:29:24.763 --> 00:29:26.306
Play shogi.

00:29:34.189 --> 00:29:36.399
I'm Seigo Todou.

00:29:41.488 --> 00:29:43.031
I'm Asuka Kunimi.

00:29:46.534 --> 00:29:47.577
Ouch, it hurts!

00:29:48.244 --> 00:29:50.288
Idiot! Can't you be more gentle?

00:29:50.371 --> 00:29:51.372
You're too heavy!

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:54.000
And crazy in the head too!

00:29:54.083 --> 00:29:56.419
Says the one who tried to stab her dad!

00:29:57.045 --> 00:29:58.463
- Oh, wait…
- What?

00:29:58.546 --> 00:30:01.549
My foot, I can't move my right foot!

00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:02.759
What?

00:30:02.842 --> 00:30:05.011
Ah, it hurts.

00:30:05.929 --> 00:30:06.805
It hurt--

00:30:06.888 --> 00:30:08.515
- Ouch, it hurts!
- Hey!

00:30:08.598 --> 00:30:10.308
Ouch.

00:30:15.063 --> 00:30:16.439
Help me get up.

00:30:23.905 --> 00:30:25.114
ROOK

00:30:25.198 --> 00:30:26.991
Asuka Kunimi…

00:30:38.044 --> 00:30:39.170
It hurts…

00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:42.507
Hey. Please.

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:44.008
Pull me up.

00:30:44.092 --> 00:30:45.510
Ouch!

00:30:45.593 --> 00:30:46.719
Hey, are you listening?

00:30:47.554 --> 00:30:51.349
You're not qualified
to play against Shoichi Yuuki.

00:30:51.432 --> 00:30:54.936
The association reached out.
They want you to be the next chairman.

00:30:55.019 --> 00:30:58.982
I know you've always dreamed of us
standing at the top of the shogi world.

00:31:01.776 --> 00:31:02.861
I lost?

00:31:02.944 --> 00:31:04.654
You're not bad for a beginner.

00:31:04.737 --> 00:31:06.823
Tell me. Why did I lose?

00:31:06.906 --> 00:31:08.199
Don't underestimate shogi.

00:31:08.283 --> 00:31:11.286
Ever wondered why
Shoichi left you and your mother?

00:31:11.369 --> 00:31:13.454
Maybe because you were so worthless!

00:31:13.538 --> 00:31:14.414
What?!

00:31:14.497 --> 00:31:16.791
It pissed me off, so I wanted to kill him.

00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:20.461
Come to this pit every day
and play shogi to death.

00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:23.006
If you lose here, give up on your revenge.

00:31:23.631 --> 00:31:24.757
{\an8}Huh?

00:31:25.341 --> 00:31:26.926
{\an8}Let's have a good game.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.937
