It's been 5,479 days...

00:01:05.852 --> 00:01:07.822
since I lost Jun.

00:01:09.022 --> 00:01:10.092
This child...

00:01:10.452 --> 00:01:12.962
is he Mr. Shin's son?

00:01:15.092 --> 00:01:16.362
What's with that look?

00:01:17.232 --> 00:01:19.331
It's a security deposit return lawsuit.

00:01:19.332 --> 00:01:21.902
The plaintiff and the defendant grew up together at an orphanage.

00:01:22.802 --> 00:01:24.102
Oh, this is great.

00:01:24.372 --> 00:01:25.742
Keep fighting.

00:01:25.942 --> 00:01:27.902
Why does it feel like they're both victims?

00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:32.782
There are these investment groups joined by word-of-mouth...

00:01:33.282 --> 00:01:35.082
They clean you out completely.

00:01:35.152 --> 00:01:36.381
My mom contacted me.

00:01:36.382 --> 00:01:37.682
She offered me this building.

00:01:37.752 --> 00:01:40.282
Follow Oh Mi Sook, then meet Pillip.

00:01:40.382 --> 00:01:42.652
- What took you so long? - Do you know her?

00:01:45.362 --> 00:01:46.362
Seung Mu!

00:01:46.892 --> 00:01:48.092
- Hey, Seung Mu. - Seung Mu!

00:01:48.662 --> 00:01:51.392
Yun Dong Hee has disappeared from the hospital.

(Shin's Project)

00:04:05.802 --> 00:04:07.532
It's a drug overdose. Prep for stomach pumping.

00:04:10.872 --> 00:04:13.442
- The guardian must fill out forms. - I'll do it.

Baek Seung Mu, you bastard.

00:04:30.592 --> 00:04:32.122
They pumped his stomach,

00:04:32.562 --> 00:04:33.592
so he should wake up soon.

00:04:34.322 --> 00:04:36.162
But they said it'll take a day or two for him to recover.

00:04:38.262 --> 00:04:39.262
Jae Kyung.

00:04:40.862 --> 00:04:41.932
Can we talk for a second?

(Episode 7)

00:04:50.012 --> 00:04:51.942
Are you really going to drop the lawsuit?

00:04:52.942 --> 00:04:53.942
Yes.

00:04:54.012 --> 00:04:58.082
If you drop the lawsuit, you can't sue him for this again.

00:04:58.752 --> 00:05:00.782
And you might not get your rental deposit back.

00:05:01.252 --> 00:05:02.252
I'm still doing it.

00:05:02.322 --> 00:05:04.552
I know things are tough for Seung Mu,

00:05:05.822 --> 00:05:07.562
but you have to think about yourself, too.

00:05:09.192 --> 00:05:10.632
What, you think I haven't thought about that?

00:05:11.932 --> 00:05:12.932
I've been saving...

00:05:13.302 --> 00:05:16.602
since my first check. On top of that,

00:05:17.202 --> 00:05:20.472
- I even took out a loan. - Then why drop the suit so quickly?

00:05:22.012 --> 00:05:23.472
If I hadn't sued him,

00:05:25.542 --> 00:05:27.742
he never would've tried to kill himself.

00:05:29.782 --> 00:05:31.412
Getting scammed by his own mother,

00:05:31.982 --> 00:05:34.422
and then sued by his best friend.

00:05:37.422 --> 00:05:38.992
If I were him, I wouldn't want to live either.

00:05:40.822 --> 00:05:42.492
I'm going to go check if Seung Mu is awake.

00:05:42.892 --> 00:05:43.892
Okay.

00:05:43.962 --> 00:05:45.832

This guy's totally fine.

00:06:17.192 --> 00:06:20.432
Wait, I thought Yun Dong Hee was a complete basket case.

00:06:20.932 --> 00:06:25.072
He was drooling just the other day. How can he suddenly be like this?

00:06:25.202 --> 00:06:28.972
We're looking into it. We found pills the patient hid.

00:06:29.372 --> 00:06:31.612
- He hid his meds? - Yes.

00:06:31.672 --> 00:06:34.082
So that means he wasn't taking them.

00:06:36.652 --> 00:06:38.652
See? I knew it.

00:06:38.922 --> 00:06:41.022
So they've been drugging a perfectly sane person all this time...

00:06:41.652 --> 00:06:42.852
just to make him seem crazy.

00:06:43.252 --> 00:06:45.792

Fifteen years ago today,

00:06:58.842 --> 00:07:00.802
Jun's time stood still.

00:07:02.312 --> 00:07:03.672
And so did mine.

00:07:05.112 --> 00:07:07.442
Yours, too. It'd better stay that way.

00:07:08.482 --> 00:07:11.752
If you ever feel even an ounce of relief,

00:07:13.182 --> 00:07:15.122
I will kill you myself.

00:07:37.842 --> 00:07:41.412
No, let go of me! Let me see his personal physician!

00:07:41.482 --> 00:07:43.152
Why on earth not?

00:07:43.212 --> 00:07:45.882
I told you, he's not here right now. Please don't cause a scene.

00:07:45.952 --> 00:07:47.182
You call this a scene?

00:07:47.552 --> 00:07:49.252
Are you even doing your jobs?

00:07:49.592 --> 00:07:51.992
You're the ones who let him walk right out, aren't you?

00:07:52.092 --> 00:07:53.462
Then come back with a warrant.

00:07:53.522 --> 00:07:57.562
A warrant? A killer escaped. Why do I need one?

00:07:57.662 --> 00:07:59.732
Hey! Get his physician out here!

00:08:12.512 --> 00:08:14.812
There's no way Yun Dong Hee could've done this alone.

00:08:15.312 --> 00:08:18.082
He must be working with whoever prescribed him those drugs.

00:08:18.452 --> 00:08:21.582
Why won't they let me see the doctor? What? Because it's too late?

00:08:21.652 --> 00:08:23.552
What a load of crap.

00:08:25.592 --> 00:08:26.592

You don't get what I'm doing either, do you, Mr. Shin?

00:08:39.542 --> 00:08:43.712
No. We just have different priorities.

00:08:43.942 --> 00:08:46.442
I just need to find the man who killed my son.

00:08:46.782 --> 00:08:48.112
Nothing else matters to me.

00:08:49.282 --> 00:08:50.412
Get home safe.

- Player Kim. - Yes?

00:09:01.722 --> 00:09:04.132
See if Yun Dong Hee has any money stashed away.

00:09:04.992 --> 00:09:06.001
Money?

00:09:06.002 --> 00:09:07.002
Right.

00:09:08.032 --> 00:09:09.632

There would be side effects.

Trouble walking, difficulty speaking,

and being drowsy at random times.

00:10:08.222 --> 00:10:09.662
So they'd just be completely out of it?

00:10:09.962 --> 00:10:12.532

I was up all night thinking about this.

This just doesn't make any sense at all.

You were the one who asked, "Why drop the suit for no money?"

You're so dense.

Mr. Shin isn't acting like himself.

I know, right?

00:12:41.942 --> 00:12:44.011
He went to the orphanage and heard their whole story,

00:12:44.012 --> 00:12:45.982
so why is he acting like this now?

00:12:46.082 --> 00:12:47.722
Just give him some space and wait.

00:12:48.022 --> 00:12:49.522
He must have a reason he can't share.

Goodness.

There was a fire in his eyes.

00:13:10.412 --> 00:13:12.612
Didn't you say he was out of it when you visited him the other day?

00:13:13.912 --> 00:13:17.082
Did that punk say something to you?

00:13:17.212 --> 00:13:18.912
Yun Dong Hee just listened.

00:13:19.222 --> 00:13:20.282
And what did you say to him?

00:13:21.252 --> 00:13:24.652
If you ever feel even an ounce of relief,

00:13:25.192 --> 00:13:26.922
I will kill you myself.

00:13:29.232 --> 00:13:30.762
I didn't say much.

00:13:31.232 --> 00:13:32.332
Are you okay?

00:13:33.862 --> 00:13:35.232
I'm not,

00:13:36.102 --> 00:13:37.932
so I have to do something.

00:13:47.112 --> 00:13:49.182
- Judge Kim. - Yes?

00:13:49.252 --> 00:13:50.311
Is it over just because they settled?

00:13:50.312 --> 00:13:52.952
You told me to see it as a citizen.

00:13:53.122 --> 00:13:55.352
Yes. Wasn't it an amicable settlement?

00:13:55.422 --> 00:13:58.092
But it's a lose-lose for both of them. It's not right.

00:13:58.152 --> 00:14:00.662
Then you wrap it up in a way you think is right.

00:14:00.722 --> 00:14:02.632
- Of course, I will. - You absolutely should.

00:14:04.432 --> 00:14:05.432
One more thing.

00:14:07.602 --> 00:14:11.272
If Mr. Shin does anything unusual, you call me immediately.

00:14:11.532 --> 00:14:12.802
What do you mean by "anything unusual?"

00:14:13.042 --> 00:14:15.172
Just anything. Anything he wouldn't normally do.

00:14:16.042 --> 00:14:17.612
Why? Is something wrong?

00:14:18.472 --> 00:14:20.242
Is Mr. Shin in some kind of trouble?

00:14:20.342 --> 00:14:21.682
Just call me.

00:14:22.752 --> 00:14:23.752
But Judge Kim...

00:14:30.522 --> 00:14:31.522
Yes, Jae Kyung.

00:14:39.262 --> 00:14:41.102
- Mr. Shin. - What is it?

00:14:41.162 --> 00:14:42.402
Baek Seung Mu is getting discharged today.

00:14:42.932 --> 00:14:43.932
Today?

00:14:49.642 --> 00:14:51.612
So, why did you try to kill yourself?

00:14:52.242 --> 00:14:53.912
Because I felt sorry...

00:14:55.082 --> 00:14:56.281
and pathetic.

00:14:56.282 --> 00:14:58.882
But you didn't even steal the rental deposit.

00:14:59.322 --> 00:15:02.252
But still, she's my mom.

00:15:05.722 --> 00:15:08.622
To be honest, I was ecstatic.

00:15:09.362 --> 00:15:11.432
The mom who abandoned me when I was seven...

00:15:12.092 --> 00:15:14.532
showed up again after 19 years,

00:15:14.632 --> 00:15:17.302
and then suddenly offered to buy me a building.

00:15:18.132 --> 00:15:20.102
At first, I thought I was so lucky.

00:15:20.502 --> 00:15:22.472
I bragged about it to all my friends.

00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:24.472
Especially in front of Jae Kyung...

00:15:26.982 --> 00:15:28.182
I just kept bragging.

00:15:29.612 --> 00:15:31.252
I guess this is my punishment.

00:15:32.082 --> 00:15:33.722
For getting greedy and not knowing my place.

00:15:34.052 --> 00:15:35.992
But your friend, Jae Kyung,

00:15:36.992 --> 00:15:41.122
he thinks you took those pills because of him.

00:15:42.832 --> 00:15:44.292
Why would he think it was his fault?

00:15:44.692 --> 00:15:46.302
My mom's the one who took the money.

00:15:48.762 --> 00:15:52.702
I promised Jae Kyung I'd pay him next week.

00:15:54.472 --> 00:15:57.272
But now there's nothing I can do.

00:15:58.072 --> 00:15:59.682
What do you mean, "nothing?"

00:15:59.982 --> 00:16:04.712
You can spend the next 100 years paying it back month by month.

00:16:05.082 --> 00:16:09.652
Then you can pay your friend back and the tenants' deposits.

00:16:11.192 --> 00:16:14.492
Or you go get the money back from her yourself.

00:16:17.392 --> 00:16:20.202
- How? - You have to find a way.

00:16:20.832 --> 00:16:23.431
Until you do, don't you dare give up,

00:16:23.432 --> 00:16:24.672
and don't you dare forgive her.

00:16:27.272 --> 00:16:28.502
That money...

00:16:29.372 --> 00:16:31.242
is what you were willing to die for.

00:16:36.512 --> 00:16:39.111
- Would you like an itemized bill? - No, that's all right.

00:16:39.112 --> 00:16:40.122
Okay.

00:16:40.652 --> 00:16:44.652
- I could have paid for that. - No. Don't worry about it.

00:16:45.222 --> 00:16:46.862
Anyway, Jae Kyung.

00:16:47.292 --> 00:16:49.362
Hold off on dropping the lawsuit for now,

00:16:50.332 --> 00:16:53.132
and help us report Oh Mi Sook first.

00:16:54.232 --> 00:16:55.732
You mean Seung Mu's mom?

00:16:56.772 --> 00:16:57.772
Yes.

00:16:58.972 --> 00:17:02.002
Could you please try to convince Seung Mu for me?

00:17:05.672 --> 00:17:08.682
(Haneul Apartments)

00:17:21.722 --> 00:17:24.932
- Get home safe. - Okay, thanks. You too.

00:17:24.992 --> 00:17:26.562
- Hey, there he is! - Over there!

00:17:26.662 --> 00:17:27.662
You're Baek Seung Mu, right?

00:17:27.663 --> 00:17:28.701
Why haven't you answered your phone?

00:17:28.702 --> 00:17:31.402
- Give me back my deposit! - What do you think you're doing?

00:17:31.472 --> 00:17:32.472
Hold on! Everyone, hold on!

00:17:32.532 --> 00:17:35.072
Can't you see he's hurt? He's a victim in this too!

00:17:35.142 --> 00:17:38.512
How is he a victim? I was robbed of my life savings.

00:17:38.572 --> 00:17:42.042
- We're the victims here. - Exactly. You're Oh Mi Sook's son!

00:17:42.112 --> 00:17:43.912
We all know your family planned this scam together!

00:17:43.982 --> 00:17:45.951
I'm doing my best to find a solution,

00:17:45.952 --> 00:17:47.552
please, just be a little more patient.

00:17:47.622 --> 00:17:50.392
- Give me my money! Give it back! - Give me back my money!

00:17:50.452 --> 00:17:51.492
My money...

00:17:51.792 --> 00:17:54.622
- Give me my money! - Please, give us back our deposit!

00:17:58.232 --> 00:17:59.732
Oh my, this is the life.

00:18:14.912 --> 00:18:16.881
See? I told you you'd like the beach.

00:18:16.882 --> 00:18:18.212
So this is supposed to be Hawaii?

00:18:18.312 --> 00:18:20.222
Come on, who said we weren't going?

00:18:20.582 --> 00:18:23.092
I'm telling you, we'll go in just two weeks.

00:18:24.992 --> 00:18:27.792
A great opportunity came up. It'd be a shame to miss it.

00:18:27.922 --> 00:18:31.262
If we hustle for a few days, we can make at least a million.

00:18:33.102 --> 00:18:37.572
I worry Seung Mu will bother us. He's such a leech.

00:18:39.172 --> 00:18:43.042
Come on, you're his mother. Don't you have any maternal instincts?

00:18:43.312 --> 00:18:45.541
I had him and raised him for seven years.

00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:47.112
That's more than enough.

00:18:47.412 --> 00:18:49.281
As a kid, he looked just like his dad,

00:18:49.282 --> 00:18:51.152
and it gave me the creeps.

00:18:51.982 --> 00:18:54.182
Now he's even more of a dead ringer. It gives me goosebumps.

00:18:54.252 --> 00:18:57.992
You two had your fun. How is any of this the kid's fault?

00:18:58.052 --> 00:19:00.762
What do you mean it's not his fault? He's that bastard's flesh and blood.

00:19:01.362 --> 00:19:05.162
- Enough. Stop talking about him. - Okay.

00:19:05.432 --> 00:19:06.932
Alright, cheers!

00:19:07.862 --> 00:19:09.532
- Want to go for a boat ride? - Sounds great.

00:19:14.002 --> 00:19:16.272
I told you to go home and get some proper rest.

00:19:17.972 --> 00:19:19.212
Forget it, man.

00:19:20.342 --> 00:19:21.842
I'm worried about what you might do.

00:19:24.352 --> 00:19:25.512
Just get some sleep.

00:19:40.302 --> 00:19:41.402
Mommy...

00:19:42.132 --> 00:19:43.632
will be back for you soon.

00:19:44.072 --> 00:19:46.902
- Don't go. - Sorry, Mommy will be back soon.

00:19:46.972 --> 00:19:48.802
- Don't go! - I'm so sorry, I have to go.

00:19:48.872 --> 00:19:50.442
I said don't go!

00:19:56.182 --> 00:19:57.352
Here, this too.

00:20:00.452 --> 00:20:02.992
I'll take care of everything for you.

00:20:04.122 --> 00:20:06.722
But you said you'd pay back Jae Kyung this month.

00:20:08.392 --> 00:20:09.962
I'll pay him back once I recover my investment funds.

00:21:22.932 --> 00:21:24.272
Gosh, you're a mess.

00:21:26.572 --> 00:21:27.972
Dude, your eyes are crazy swollen.

00:21:29.072 --> 00:21:31.072
Guess that means I've got nothing to lose.

00:21:33.642 --> 00:21:34.642
Jae Kyung.

00:21:36.582 --> 00:21:38.182
You know, I was thinking.

00:21:40.022 --> 00:21:41.952
All this time, everything my mom...

00:21:42.752 --> 00:21:45.152
told me with a smile was all a lie.

00:21:46.122 --> 00:21:48.191
And even when I knew she was lying,

00:21:48.192 --> 00:21:49.362
I think I just wanted to believe her.

00:21:52.762 --> 00:21:54.962
- Seung Mu. - Yes?

00:21:55.162 --> 00:21:56.202
I used to...

00:21:58.702 --> 00:22:00.642
wish I had a mom,

00:22:02.502 --> 00:22:07.782
even one who was a liar like yours.

00:22:10.452 --> 00:22:11.512
To be honest,

00:22:12.112 --> 00:22:14.752
I think I acted like a bigger jerk because I was so jealous.

00:22:15.482 --> 00:22:17.752
You're still jealous, even after seeing this mess I'm in?

00:22:19.692 --> 00:22:20.762
I'm sorry.

00:22:21.422 --> 00:22:23.132
I didn't realise how much you were suffering.

00:22:23.432 --> 00:22:24.632
What are you sorry for?

00:22:26.302 --> 00:22:27.962
I'm the one who should be sorry.

00:22:30.002 --> 00:22:32.172
I swear I'll find a way to pay you back.

00:22:32.372 --> 00:22:34.942
Why would you do that? What's there to pay back?

00:22:35.402 --> 00:22:36.712
Your mom is the one who has to pay it back.

00:22:38.742 --> 00:22:40.542
I'm telling you, it's not your fault.

00:22:42.142 --> 00:22:44.412
Forget it, man. Go wash up and get some sleep.

00:22:52.722 --> 00:22:54.162
You have to find a way.

00:22:54.892 --> 00:22:57.461
Until you do, don't you dare give up,

00:22:57.462 --> 00:22:58.832
and don't you dare forgive her.

00:23:01.202 --> 00:23:02.232
That money...

00:23:03.372 --> 00:23:05.332
is what you were willing to die for.

00:23:19.012 --> 00:23:22.182
Gosh, that greasy look of yours is ruining my drink.

00:23:23.722 --> 00:23:27.122
- Why do I feel so anxious? - What are you so anxious about?

00:23:27.362 --> 00:23:28.762
You. You're what makes me uneasy.

00:23:29.692 --> 00:23:32.962
- Mr. Shin, I know you are upset... - But I'm not.

00:23:36.262 --> 00:23:39.432
I'm not frustrated. Quite the opposite, actually.

00:23:41.342 --> 00:23:43.812
Every time I went to visit Yun Dong Hee,

00:23:43.872 --> 00:23:46.382
I was hoping that bastard would be in his right mind.

00:23:46.712 --> 00:23:49.912
So he'd understand exactly what I was saying.

00:23:51.012 --> 00:23:55.222
Because I had questions for him and things I had to do.

00:23:55.882 --> 00:24:00.762
Now I finally get to say what I want, so why would I be frustrated?

00:24:00.992 --> 00:24:03.192
That bastard Yun Dong Hee is perfectly fine now.

00:24:03.892 --> 00:24:07.662
Fine. When you see him, Mr. Shin, ask him whatever you want.

00:24:07.732 --> 00:24:08.732
Just one thing.

00:24:09.632 --> 00:24:11.402
After the police have him,

00:24:11.932 --> 00:24:13.102
ask him then.

00:24:14.372 --> 00:24:15.772
You get what I'm saying, right?

00:24:17.742 --> 00:24:20.042
You're paying for drinks tonight.

00:24:24.652 --> 00:24:25.812
Like you ever pay.

00:24:31.092 --> 00:24:32.452
(Chicken Center)

00:24:34.922 --> 00:24:36.391
So, Baek Seung Mu is reporting her?

00:24:36.392 --> 00:24:38.562
Yes. Are you going too, Mr. Shin?

00:24:38.732 --> 00:24:41.862
- No, I have to fry chicken. - Okay, I'll get going.

00:24:49.042 --> 00:24:51.472
- Officer Kang. - Actually, it's Detective Kang now.

00:24:52.212 --> 00:24:53.212
Have a seat.

00:24:56.082 --> 00:24:57.452
What brings you in today?

00:24:57.552 --> 00:24:59.612
I'm here as legal counsel for Baek Seung Mu.

00:24:59.922 --> 00:25:00.922
Yes.

00:25:00.982 --> 00:25:04.092
I'm here to report Oh Mi Sook, my mother.

00:25:04.292 --> 00:25:07.022
- On what charges? - Embezzlement and document forgery.

00:25:07.392 --> 00:25:10.431
Baek Seung Mu never directly received the tenants' deposits.

00:25:10.432 --> 00:25:12.362
That money was all managed by Oh Mi Sook.

00:25:12.532 --> 00:25:15.502
She showed them fake documents and promised them a profit.

00:25:15.562 --> 00:25:16.872
We have all the supporting documents.

00:25:17.502 --> 00:25:20.842
We'll also file a formal complaint from Baek Seung Mu.

00:25:20.902 --> 00:25:23.172
I see. Yes...

00:25:23.442 --> 00:25:25.072
I understand the situation.

00:25:25.842 --> 00:25:26.982
Excuse me, Detective.

00:25:27.512 --> 00:25:30.652
I'm going to find a way, no matter what.

00:25:31.012 --> 00:25:33.822
And until I do, I won't give up or forgive her.

00:25:34.252 --> 00:25:35.282
Because that money...

00:25:37.492 --> 00:25:38.992
is what I was willing to die for.

00:25:48.662 --> 00:25:50.972
Stop sighing. It's bad luck.

00:25:51.502 --> 00:25:52.602
You filed the report?

00:25:53.202 --> 00:25:54.772
We filed it,

00:25:55.042 --> 00:25:58.012
but if Oh Mi Sook refuses to pay up, there's no way to force her.

00:25:58.272 --> 00:25:59.472
You're just figuring that out now?

00:26:01.112 --> 00:26:02.882
That's how full of loopholes the law is.

00:26:02.942 --> 00:26:05.512
No, it's not that the law is flawed. People exploit it.

00:26:05.582 --> 00:26:07.022
And I won't let her get away with it.

00:26:07.122 --> 00:26:08.752
Same difference.

00:26:10.322 --> 00:26:13.462
We just have to make Oh Mi Sook cough up the money, right?

00:26:18.532 --> 00:26:19.862
Are you going to persuade her, Mr. Shin?

00:26:20.162 --> 00:26:23.032
Persuasion is for when you're dealing with human beings.

00:26:24.832 --> 00:26:26.902
When you're dealing with something less than human,

00:26:27.702 --> 00:26:29.942
you give it the kind of treatment...

00:26:30.642 --> 00:26:31.712
it deserves.

00:26:36.012 --> 00:26:38.212

00:26:38.312 --> 00:26:41.582
- You're here for the meal, right? - Yes, if you just go over there...

00:26:41.652 --> 00:26:43.822
Enjoy your meal, sir. Yes.

00:26:43.892 --> 00:26:45.822

00:26:48.462 --> 00:26:50.132
I'm good for now. Can I come back for seconds?

00:26:50.192 --> 00:26:52.332
- Here you go. - Hello.

00:26:52.392 --> 00:26:53.532
- Hey, what's with all this booze? - Please, have some.

00:26:53.962 --> 00:26:57.102
- Here you go. Come on, eat up. - Thank you so much.

00:26:57.172 --> 00:26:58.602
It's nice and cold.

00:26:59.272 --> 00:27:00.272
Here you go.

00:27:00.802 --> 00:27:02.402
Enjoy your meal. Okay.

00:27:02.702 --> 00:27:03.912
Sir, let me pour you a drink.

00:27:04.242 --> 00:27:05.312
- Yes, yes. - Thank you.

00:27:06.612 --> 00:27:08.282
Let me pour you one. There you go.

00:27:08.812 --> 00:27:10.012
Enjoy.

00:27:15.782 --> 00:27:16.892
Eat up, everyone.

00:27:18.392 --> 00:27:19.392
Oh, boy.

00:27:19.752 --> 00:27:21.092
Should I pour you one?

00:27:21.462 --> 00:27:22.722
That'd be wonderful.

00:27:23.292 --> 00:27:24.732
Here we go...

00:27:25.092 --> 00:27:28.102
You look a whole lot like my uncle.

00:27:29.902 --> 00:27:31.002
Alright, cheers.

00:27:32.202 --> 00:27:35.142
Sir, have some of this while it's hot. There you go.

00:27:35.202 --> 00:27:37.172
Thank you very much.

00:27:53.522 --> 00:27:55.762
(Sunrise Apartment, Now Selling)

00:28:00.532 --> 00:28:03.572
- You're here. - Hello.

00:28:03.902 --> 00:28:06.842
Wow, a new car again? Seriously?

00:28:08.042 --> 00:28:09.042
Come on.

00:28:09.372 --> 00:28:10.612
Hello, everyone.

00:28:11.512 --> 00:28:14.912
- I like it. - You think the colour works?

00:28:15.012 --> 00:28:16.012
Nice!

00:28:18.112 --> 00:28:20.352
- There. - Let me see.

00:28:21.322 --> 00:28:23.352
- It's all here, right? - Hey, come on.

00:28:23.652 --> 00:28:25.052
This isn't our first rodeo.

00:28:25.652 --> 00:28:28.592
I'm flying out next week, so this needs to be done right away.

00:28:28.892 --> 00:28:30.732
I'll make it worth your while.

00:28:31.192 --> 00:28:33.092
Alright, looks good!

00:28:33.362 --> 00:28:34.402
Let's go.

00:28:38.472 --> 00:28:40.272
(Jungang-dong Community Service Center)

00:28:40.402 --> 00:28:43.242
No way. Hold on a second.

00:28:45.042 --> 00:28:46.342
Wait a minute.

00:28:46.542 --> 00:28:49.142
Please confirm. Yes, that place is great.

00:28:49.312 --> 00:28:52.882
Hey, Player Kim. Trace Lee In Chul's burner phone.

00:28:54.982 --> 00:28:56.452
So Mr. Shin wants to meet with you?

00:28:56.852 --> 00:28:59.322
- Why? - How should I know?

00:28:59.692 --> 00:29:03.532
Hey, if he asks for a gun, don't get one.

00:29:03.862 --> 00:29:05.432
A gun? In South Korea?

00:29:06.232 --> 00:29:08.732
Mr. Chairman, I need you to get me a gun.

00:29:10.002 --> 00:29:12.372
Mr. Shin, what's gotten into you?

00:29:12.702 --> 00:29:14.672
Don't you know gun control is strict in South Korea?

00:29:15.042 --> 00:29:18.142
I can get you anything but a gun. It's out of the question.

00:29:18.472 --> 00:29:21.612
- You'll get me anything else? - Yes. Anything but the gun.

00:29:22.582 --> 00:29:23.652
In that case,

00:29:24.682 --> 00:29:26.552
find me someone who's discreet,

00:29:27.082 --> 00:29:30.152
- and good with a needle. - A needle?

00:29:30.522 --> 00:29:32.652
- They have to be discreet, too? - Extremely.

00:29:34.862 --> 00:29:39.592
When it comes to being discreet, no one's better than you, Madam Joo.

00:29:39.732 --> 00:29:41.632
But injections? Since when?

00:29:42.862 --> 00:29:45.002
- Not me. - What?

00:29:46.302 --> 00:29:47.442
You were looking for me?

00:29:47.802 --> 00:29:51.072
There, the one who's discreet and good with a needle.

00:29:51.772 --> 00:29:54.812
Manager Bae, when did you say you got your nursing license?

00:29:54.882 --> 00:29:56.442
Three years after I got out of prison.

00:29:56.752 --> 00:30:00.822
I got it to find a job. My friend was at a nursing school,

00:30:00.882 --> 00:30:03.422
and she said they needed more guys, so I should give it a shot.

00:30:06.962 --> 00:30:08.922
- Are you sure? - Positive.

00:30:09.392 --> 00:30:12.262
What's with the glare? Gosh.

00:30:16.502 --> 00:30:19.732
Okay. Hey, Mr. Shin!

00:30:19.802 --> 00:30:21.472
I got a location on the burner phone.

00:30:22.175 --> 00:30:23.175
Yes.

00:30:23.645 --> 00:30:25.645
Okay, Player Kim. Got it. Thanks.

00:30:26.015 --> 00:30:27.015
Hey, Pillip.

00:30:27.545 --> 00:30:29.115
Get ready for a business trip. We leave tomorrow.

00:30:29.585 --> 00:30:31.985
- Did you find Oh Mi Sook? - I thought she skipped town.

00:30:32.655 --> 00:30:36.125
That's weird. She definitely said she asked to move her flight up.

00:30:36.355 --> 00:30:40.025
No, she didn't get on the plane. We pinged Lee In Chul's burner.

00:30:40.895 --> 00:30:43.135
- I want to go, too. - Okay. You can come, Si On.

00:30:46.465 --> 00:30:48.205
What? We're a team, aren't we?

00:30:48.565 --> 00:30:50.475
Who knows where that nasty couple is hiding.

00:30:52.335 --> 00:30:53.805
If it's a beach town...

00:30:54.075 --> 00:30:56.145
Maybe a hotel or motel again?

00:30:59.275 --> 00:31:00.285
I guess so.

00:31:00.785 --> 00:31:01.785
Dressed for a date again?

00:31:04.385 --> 00:31:05.385
What are you so happy about?

00:31:05.885 --> 00:31:06.885
Think this is a vacation?

00:31:07.155 --> 00:31:09.085
- What did I do? - Whatever.

00:31:12.595 --> 00:31:14.425
I saw it.

00:31:15.195 --> 00:31:18.295
The photos came out great. The sky in Clark was so beautiful.

00:31:19.365 --> 00:31:21.805
Mom. Guess what? Estelle got a boyfriend.

00:31:22.105 --> 00:31:23.105
Really?

00:31:24.975 --> 00:31:27.775
Someone must be jealous. Your best friend got a boyfriend.

00:31:28.175 --> 00:31:29.745
Not really.

00:31:30.245 --> 00:31:31.715
I have a crush, too.

00:31:32.045 --> 00:31:33.045
What?

00:31:33.515 --> 00:31:36.585
- You do? Who? - Sung Hanbin from ZEROBASEONE.

00:31:37.315 --> 00:31:41.155
- Sung Hanbin from ZEROBASEONE? - He's so handsome.

00:31:41.325 --> 00:31:42.325
Come on.

00:31:42.725 --> 00:31:44.895
How many celebrity crushes do you have?

00:31:45.225 --> 00:31:47.525
All right. Okay.

00:31:48.325 --> 00:31:50.765
- Talk to you tomorrow. - Good night, Mommy!

00:31:50.865 --> 00:31:51.865
Okay.

00:31:59.705 --> 00:32:00.975
Did you pack everything you need?

00:32:01.245 --> 00:32:03.975
Yes. But are you sure it's okay if I go?

00:32:04.045 --> 00:32:06.175
Why? Are you worried about Kim Yong Woo?

00:32:07.815 --> 00:32:09.245
I'm worried something might happen while I'm away.

00:32:13.825 --> 00:32:15.755
Go on. Don't worry about me.

00:32:16.425 --> 00:32:17.425
Understood.

00:32:18.025 --> 00:32:21.165
- Call me if anything happens. - I will.

00:32:51.495 --> 00:32:53.565
The places they've been wandering for the past week...

00:32:53.695 --> 00:32:56.535
are homeless shelters, the terminal, and the coast.

00:32:57.935 --> 00:32:59.265
Homeless shelters.

00:32:59.835 --> 00:33:01.935
There are lots of homeless people at the terminal and the coast, too.

00:33:02.435 --> 00:33:04.975
- They're scamming homeless people? - By stealing their identities.

00:33:05.475 --> 00:33:08.445
All right, you two should secure evidence for the police.

00:33:08.945 --> 00:33:11.414
I'll find Oh Mi Sook and Lee In Chul.

00:33:11.415 --> 00:33:13.175
See you in three hours. Call me.

00:33:13.615 --> 00:33:15.285
- Got it. - Got it.

00:33:19.285 --> 00:33:20.285
Mr. Lee In Chul.

00:33:20.985 --> 00:33:22.285
You have a reservation?

00:33:23.555 --> 00:33:25.125
I'm here to escort you. Shall we?

00:33:26.195 --> 00:33:27.195
Please have this before your meal.

00:33:27.965 --> 00:33:28.995
It's good for detoxing your liver.

00:33:29.425 --> 00:33:30.965
Great.

00:33:31.835 --> 00:33:33.765
- Great service. - Thank you.

00:33:41.745 --> 00:33:42.805
Thank you.

00:34:02.725 --> 00:34:04.565
- Where's Ji Woo? - You're disgusting.

00:34:05.035 --> 00:34:06.065
Don't you dare say my daughter's name.

00:34:06.135 --> 00:34:09.705
I don't have time for this. Where did you stash her?

00:34:10.235 --> 00:34:12.635
- Where is Ji Woo? - Are you even human?

00:34:13.175 --> 00:34:14.745
How dare you show your face here after what you did to her?

00:34:14.805 --> 00:34:17.175
Darn it! Where is Ji Woo?

00:34:20.315 --> 00:34:21.315
Get out!

00:34:21.685 --> 00:34:24.185
If you ever show your face again, I'll kill you.

00:34:24.755 --> 00:34:25.755
I'm not kidding.

00:34:26.485 --> 00:34:28.325
You will never see Ji Woo again as long as you live.

00:34:50.545 --> 00:34:51.545
Unbelievable.

00:35:05.055 --> 00:35:09.995
Hey, I hear it'll be raining next week, so...

00:35:10.195 --> 00:35:13.035
Excuse me. Have you seen these people by any chance?

00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:14.865
Hey, we're trying to eat here!

00:35:15.205 --> 00:35:17.005
- Just go away. - Seriously, get out of here.

00:35:17.075 --> 00:35:18.175
- We're sorry. - Sorry.

00:35:18.235 --> 00:35:19.535
- Seriously. - What do you think you're doing?

00:35:19.805 --> 00:35:20.945
Hurry up and eat.

00:35:22.175 --> 00:35:24.845
Excuse me. Have you seen this person by any chance?

00:35:27.985 --> 00:35:30.785
Have you seen these people?

00:35:30.955 --> 00:35:32.815
They came by a few times last week.

00:35:33.455 --> 00:35:34.455
Why?

00:35:36.995 --> 00:35:39.825
Excuse me. Have you seen this person by any chance?

00:35:39.895 --> 00:35:42.324
- I said I don't know! Just go away! - Excuse me, sir.

00:35:42.325 --> 00:35:43.935
Excuse me, have you seen this person?

00:35:45.665 --> 00:35:46.905
Have you seen this person?

00:35:48.165 --> 00:35:52.035
Hi there. Have you seen these people?

00:35:52.235 --> 00:35:54.005
Yes, I know them.

00:35:54.575 --> 00:35:55.575
You've seen them?

00:35:55.845 --> 00:35:58.045
It was a few days ago.

00:35:58.375 --> 00:36:01.415
My wallet disappeared after they came by.

00:36:01.515 --> 00:36:03.485
I can't imagine why they took it.

00:36:05.255 --> 00:36:09.025
- Sir, what's your name? - Kang Young Mook.

00:36:09.325 --> 00:36:10.825
Do you remember your ID number by any chance?

00:36:11.195 --> 00:36:14.095
Let's see, my ID number...

00:36:15.125 --> 00:36:17.695
Detective Kang, I think Oh Mi Sook is up to no good.

00:36:18.095 --> 00:36:19.835
Yes, can you please run a property check?

00:36:20.205 --> 00:36:21.765
The name is Kang Young Mook.

00:36:22.105 --> 00:36:23.905
The ID number starts with 600326.

00:37:12.155 --> 00:37:13.155
So, what did you find?

00:37:13.485 --> 00:37:16.085
She bought three seaside apartments in the names of homeless people.

00:37:16.555 --> 00:37:18.295
And she's already leased out two of them.

00:37:19.155 --> 00:37:20.225
So, where are you, Mr. Shin?

00:37:20.665 --> 00:37:22.695
- Have you found them? - I'll find them.

00:37:23.065 --> 00:37:24.065
All right, I'll call you.

00:37:25.295 --> 00:37:26.295
I'm all done.

00:37:26.935 --> 00:37:29.435
I had trouble finding a vein, so I had to poke a few times.

00:37:29.505 --> 00:37:32.005
Chairman Park said you're good with needles.

00:37:32.075 --> 00:37:34.005
Have you ever given him an injection?

00:37:34.075 --> 00:37:35.875
He came to the shop once with acute indigestion,

00:37:36.145 --> 00:37:37.345
so I pricked his thumb for him.

00:37:41.185 --> 00:37:43.585
How did you even come up with this?

00:37:45.355 --> 00:37:48.325
I usually try to avoid methods like this.

00:37:49.325 --> 00:37:50.755
Back in the day, in South America,

00:37:51.025 --> 00:37:55.065
I used this tactic on the Mafia. Back then, I used a gun, not drugs.

00:37:56.765 --> 00:37:58.935
Because their crimes are so heinous.

00:37:59.295 --> 00:38:00.405
I'll be on my way.

00:38:00.835 --> 00:38:02.235
Call me if you need help.

00:38:02.635 --> 00:38:03.835
To keep things fair.

00:38:18.115 --> 00:38:19.115
Hi, come on in.

00:38:19.555 --> 00:38:21.755
- We're here to see a place. - Looking for a monthly rental?

00:38:22.025 --> 00:38:23.285
Or a short-term lease?

00:38:25.095 --> 00:38:28.825
A key-money lease. Hubby just got transferred here.

00:38:29.265 --> 00:38:31.665
- "Hubby?" - I see.

00:38:31.995 --> 00:38:36.035
Have a seat. I have a new building with a fine view.

00:38:36.635 --> 00:38:37.635
Take a look here.

00:38:38.575 --> 00:38:40.545
Honey! He says the view is great.

00:38:44.775 --> 00:38:46.985
- I like it too. - Sit down!

00:38:53.385 --> 00:38:56.185
The person you scammed died from an overdose.

00:38:56.895 --> 00:38:59.495
And I'm here to collect the bounty.

00:39:00.365 --> 00:39:02.225
I'll be taking a life for a life.

00:39:02.825 --> 00:39:06.935
Just one of you. You two can decide who it will be.

00:39:08.665 --> 00:39:10.065
You have three minutes.

00:39:10.335 --> 00:39:12.835
If you don't decide by the alarm's end, you both die.

00:39:13.575 --> 00:39:15.905
But you'll die anyway when this IV bag runs out.

00:39:19.175 --> 00:39:20.885
There's nothing nearby,

00:39:21.515 --> 00:39:22.715
so don't waste your breath screaming.

00:39:26.285 --> 00:39:27.285
Wait, sir.

00:39:27.725 --> 00:39:29.025
Why are you doing this?

00:39:29.785 --> 00:39:31.055
So, is this about the...

00:39:31.695 --> 00:39:34.995
Is this because of that tip I gave you a while back?

00:39:35.425 --> 00:39:37.865
So you really did invest in it.

00:39:38.295 --> 00:39:43.134
This kind of thing just takes time. Please give me a little longer.

00:39:43.135 --> 00:39:45.935
What is this? You two know each other? Who is this guy?

00:39:46.435 --> 00:39:47.445
Who are you?

00:39:47.675 --> 00:39:48.875
I said, who are you?

00:39:49.075 --> 00:39:53.215
I was wrong. Sir, I was truly in the wrong.

00:39:53.415 --> 00:39:55.045
If you just spare my life this once,

00:39:55.085 --> 00:39:56.585
if you just give me one more chance...

00:39:56.915 --> 00:39:59.755
Untie me, please! This is all your fault.

00:39:59.855 --> 00:40:03.325
He's the bad guy here. He's the one who taught me everything.

00:40:03.385 --> 00:40:06.755
Hey, what do you mean I taught you? You're the worse one here.

00:40:06.965 --> 00:40:09.125
You're the one who scammed your own darn kid!

00:40:09.195 --> 00:40:11.735
You taught me to do that! He's the ringleader,

00:40:11.795 --> 00:40:12.834
I was just doing what he told me.

00:40:12.835 --> 00:40:14.964
No, no. That's not true. Sir, it's absolutely not me.

00:40:14.965 --> 00:40:16.804
She's the truly evil one.

00:40:16.805 --> 00:40:19.805
- He's the one who's lying! - She's lying to you right now.

- It wasn't me. - What are you talking about?

00:40:22.145 --> 00:40:23.845
- Sir, please. - Time's up.

00:40:24.515 --> 00:40:27.115
Please, sir.

00:40:28.345 --> 00:40:29.915
Somebody help!

00:40:33.215 --> 00:40:34.885
Look at this jerk.

00:40:35.155 --> 00:40:37.195
No, don't.

00:40:55.505 --> 00:40:59.875
Sir, you've got it wrong. Please.

Hey, wait! Please!

00:41:07.125 --> 00:41:09.985
Honey, I really love this place.

00:41:10.255 --> 00:41:13.995
- Let's sign the lease, okay? - But isn't the deposit steep?

00:41:14.125 --> 00:41:16.995
It's a new building, and the view is to die for.

00:41:17.095 --> 00:41:19.595
Ma'am, if you don't take this now, it'll be off the market immediately.

00:41:20.565 --> 00:41:22.035
Come on, honey!

00:41:27.345 --> 00:41:29.075
I'm going to make a quick call to my parents.

00:41:30.515 --> 00:41:31.875
Okay, but hurry back.

00:41:34.515 --> 00:41:35.915
Looks like you've got him wrapped around your finger.

00:41:37.615 --> 00:41:38.615
You think so?

00:41:38.685 --> 00:41:40.885
I'm in the same boat. Takes one to know one.

00:41:43.355 --> 00:41:45.595
- Where are you now? - Almost there.

00:41:45.655 --> 00:41:48.125
- Then, I'll prepare the contract. - Okay.

00:41:48.595 --> 00:41:51.195
All right, you're all set.

00:41:51.635 --> 00:41:53.595
So, why isn't the landlord here?

00:41:53.935 --> 00:41:56.265
I'm a bit worried about rent scams going around lately.

Aren't you even a little bit curious?

00:49:58.786 --> 00:50:00.556
I already figured it out on the way here.

00:50:01.086 --> 00:50:02.956

00:50:40.096 --> 00:50:41.296
Come on, it's not that scary.

00:51:51.666 --> 00:51:54.436
Go have fun at the beach and take the train when you return.

00:52:18.426 --> 00:52:19.526
What are you thinking about?

00:52:21.826 --> 00:52:22.826
About my mom.

00:52:23.826 --> 00:52:26.136
She left home when Ye On was two.

00:52:27.466 --> 00:52:29.836
Maybe it's because she has no memory of her?

00:52:31.336 --> 00:52:33.706
Ye On says she feels nothing, even looking at our mom's picture.

00:52:36.906 --> 00:52:37.916
What about you?

00:52:39.576 --> 00:52:41.886
It would've been better if she'd never been there at all.

00:52:43.846 --> 00:52:45.516
But to have her and then lose her is...

00:52:47.586 --> 00:52:48.786
It's kind of sad, isn't it?

00:53:08.306 --> 00:53:11.916
What do you mean? It was real! Look, don't you see this evidence?

00:53:12.146 --> 00:53:15.146
We suspected drugs were involved, so we ran a full toxicology screen.

00:53:15.216 --> 00:53:19.285
But only his blood glucose levels came back abnormally high.

00:53:19.286 --> 00:53:23.626
This is so frustrating! When In Chul collapsed by me, foaming,

00:53:23.726 --> 00:53:27.896
I was so shocked when I saw it, I begged them to just let him live.

00:53:27.966 --> 00:53:29.996
And that's why I sent them all the money!

00:53:30.666 --> 00:53:33.396
Effervescent vitamins foam up when you take them.

00:53:33.636 --> 00:53:36.666
You knew you'd go to jail if you were caught for fraud.

00:53:37.036 --> 00:53:38.436
So you staged the whole thing.

00:53:38.506 --> 00:53:41.676
Staged? What are you talking about? This is driving me nuts.

00:53:41.746 --> 00:53:44.576
I'm telling you, someone forced me to take it!

00:53:44.646 --> 00:53:48.246
Forced you? Who forced you? We found pills in Oh Mi Sook's bag.

00:53:48.316 --> 00:53:50.216
And you took them along with the vitamins.

00:53:51.186 --> 00:53:53.016
No, that can't be true.

00:53:53.156 --> 00:53:55.926
I saw it clearly with my own two eyes.

00:53:56.056 --> 00:53:59.056
The money scammed in your son's name. Where did you stash it?

00:53:59.126 --> 00:54:02.226
You're aware that Baek Seung Mu reported you, right?

00:54:03.996 --> 00:54:05.096
Seung Mu did?

00:54:06.636 --> 00:54:11.376
He reported me? Hey, can you bring Seung Mu in here?

00:54:11.606 --> 00:54:15.946
But I'm his mother. There's no way he would report me.

00:54:18.376 --> 00:54:23.016

You don't have to see her if you don't want to.

00:54:29.656 --> 00:54:30.656
He's right.

00:54:31.086 --> 00:54:32.796
Just do whatever you feel is right.

00:54:33.656 --> 00:54:34.696
It's okay.

00:54:35.426 --> 00:54:36.466
I'm fine.

00:54:37.296 --> 00:54:38.896
Okay, let's go.

00:55:02.926 --> 00:55:07.896
I missed you so, so much.

00:55:09.326 --> 00:55:13.166
Well... I've been through a terrifying ordeal,

00:55:13.236 --> 00:55:16.906
I can barely think straight. But a detective said something weird.

00:55:17.306 --> 00:55:18.776
She said you're the one who reported me.

00:55:19.236 --> 00:55:21.306
That's not true, is it?

00:55:21.476 --> 00:55:24.846
- She's mistaken, right? - I did report you.

00:55:25.746 --> 00:55:26.746
What?

00:55:27.116 --> 00:55:28.646
What are you talking about?

00:55:29.546 --> 00:55:31.916
You really reported me? Your own mother?

00:55:32.086 --> 00:55:33.556
Were you angry with me?

00:55:34.656 --> 00:55:37.426
Come on, we're family.

00:55:37.956 --> 00:55:40.056
- Drop the charges now. - But we're family.

00:55:41.126 --> 00:55:42.696
Then why did you do that to me?

00:55:43.866 --> 00:55:45.836
- What? - You said we were family.

00:55:46.796 --> 00:55:50.236
You say we're family, but you lied to me and used me.

00:55:50.366 --> 00:55:51.836
So why would you do that?

00:55:52.676 --> 00:55:53.706
Listen.

00:55:54.276 --> 00:55:58.416
Ever since I was seven, I waited every single day for you.

What's wrong with him?

00:56:13.556 --> 00:56:18.366
Is that how you talk to your mother? Things just happened that way.

00:56:19.196 --> 00:56:22.806
Okay, fine. So I told you a few lies. Let's just say I did.

00:56:22.906 --> 00:56:24.506
Does that mean I'm not your family?

00:56:24.636 --> 00:56:26.606
How could you do this to your mother?

00:56:26.676 --> 00:56:27.806
My family...

00:56:27.876 --> 00:56:31.416
is Jae Kyung, the director, and the kids from the children's home.

To me...

00:56:38.216 --> 00:56:39.286
a mother...

00:56:40.356 --> 00:56:42.056
doesn't exist.

00:56:45.196 --> 00:56:46.396
You can go now.

00:56:49.326 --> 00:56:52.436
Oh Mi Sook, you abandoned your son at age seven,

00:56:52.496 --> 00:56:55.806
and used him in a depraved crime. Your sentence may be increased.

00:56:55.866 --> 00:56:57.166
Just so you know.

00:56:58.436 --> 00:56:59.976
You! Get back here!

Oh Mi Sook!

00:57:06.616 --> 00:57:10.186
You disrespectful punk. How dare you stare me down!

00:57:10.286 --> 00:57:12.856
You've got a temper just like your darn father.

00:57:13.086 --> 00:57:17.156
Do you know how creepy you are? Someone like you...

00:57:17.226 --> 00:57:19.456
should have never been born!

00:57:19.826 --> 00:57:22.196
That's the first honest thing you've said.

00:57:23.026 --> 00:57:25.866
Giving birth to me on a whim only to hurt me like this...

00:57:26.466 --> 00:57:27.966
I'll never forgive you for that.

- You did a good job. - Judge Kim, I'm sorry.

00:57:55.226 --> 00:57:58.026

but to praise you.

but you've come this far all on your own.

After all you've been through, you stick together.

00:58:18.656 --> 00:58:20.656
That made me think, "You're so strong."

00:58:20.716 --> 00:58:22.986
I really thought you were amazing.

00:58:23.056 --> 00:58:27.926
Without everyone's encouragement, I don't think I would've made it.

Me too.

00:58:29.527 --> 00:58:32.636

Rather than hearing it from some chicken restaurant owner,

00:59:25.116 --> 00:59:27.516
it sounds more impressive coming from a judge, right?

Right.

There's nothing under his name,

who died five years ago.

01:00:10.226 --> 01:00:14.636
At first, it looks like a spam text, but if you follow the link,

01:00:14.766 --> 01:00:17.006
it leads you to an offshore bank's website.

I haven't cracked the password yet. It's going to take some time.

01:00:21.746 --> 01:00:24.306
But how did you know he had money?

01:00:26.276 --> 01:00:28.386
According to Detective Choi, Yun Dong Hee...

01:00:28.446 --> 01:00:30.616
was probably paid to clean up a mess.

01:00:32.656 --> 01:00:36.156
So you're saying it was like a hit?

01:00:37.656 --> 01:00:39.396
This guy is terrifying.

01:00:41.056 --> 01:00:44.696
If that's true, he must've been paid a hefty sum.

01:00:45.036 --> 01:00:47.236
And he couldn't have spent it while he was locked up.

01:00:48.666 --> 01:00:51.706
So what's the plan after you find it?

01:00:53.536 --> 01:00:54.636
I wait.

01:00:56.906 --> 01:00:57.946
If I wait,

01:00:58.676 --> 01:01:00.616

That's it? I had to wire money to many people.

01:01:20.736 --> 01:01:23.466
