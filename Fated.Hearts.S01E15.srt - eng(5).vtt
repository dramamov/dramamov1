00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.950
First Prince.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.510
Since His Majesty no longer
holds him accountable,

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.950
then please leave the punishment

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.280
of General Xun to me.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.840
Sure.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.329
First Prince!

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.490
You've gone too far!

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.190
Princess Xiyang's wedding is
just around the corner.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.240
I hope you'll keep the bigger picture
in mind

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.700
and not break royal protocol,
First Prince.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.750
You want dignity?

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.400
Then listen carefully.

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.430
From now on, if anyone dares

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.760
to harm Fu Yixiao again,

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.280
I'll definitely kill them.

Where is he?

Guess who I am?

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.820
Why did you do that?

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.950
Are you in a bad mood?

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.460

[Wutong Mansion]

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.400
had the nerve to offend our First Prince?

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.190
Weren't you supposed to be at the border

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.150
with the Elder Marquis?

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.610
Why are you suddenly back?

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.030
Well, it's Princess Xiyang's wedding soon,
isn't it?

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.710
Can't our Murong family

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:30.310
at least send someone back

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.560
to attend the ceremony?

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.220
I was going to come back alone,

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.500
but my father insisted on coming with me.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.430
The Elder Marquis is back in Yujing too?

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.030
Yes.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.560
Since you're in a bad mood,

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.020
how about I go with you for
a couple of drinks?

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.079
Please let the Elder Marquis know

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:45.680
that I'll definitely pay him a visit

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.340
in person when I have the time.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.030
You really aren't coming drinking with me?

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.240
I'll go by myself then.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.770
Go ahead.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.710
I'm really going, you know?

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:53.340
Just go.

Lu Ke.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.310
What exactly happened

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.370
in the court today?

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.090
His Highness acted rashly today.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.840
Why was His Highness

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.520
removed from the position
of secondary officiant?

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.870
Today, His Highness mentioned
the late Empress's death

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.430
in front of His Majesty.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.120
But...

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.240
Doesn't His Majesty forbid anyone
from mentioning...

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.680
Since you know it's forbidden,
why bring it up?

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.080
Weren't you the one
who brought it up first?

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.270
I know.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.870
All these years,

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.920
when has His Highness ever

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.240
mentioned this in front of His Majesty?

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.000
And it's precisely because of this

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.830
that the father and son
were able to preserve

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.430
the last shred of their bond.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.409
But today,

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.890
His Majesty clearly knew Empress Zhuang

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:38.800
wanted to harm Miss Yixiao,

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.200
yet he turned a blind eye.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.950
What else could His Highness have done?

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.390
His Highness must have thought of

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.790
the late Empress's death,

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:47.920
so in a moment of panic,

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.520
he spoke without restraint.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.950
Even so,

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:52.040
they shouldn't let the Second Prince

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.190
take His Highness's place.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.120
Princess Xiyang

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.430
is His Highness's biological sister,

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.920
and His Highness

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.270
is His Majesty's eldest son.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.720
By every measure—emotionally, logically,
publicly, and privately—

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.320
this matter shouldn't have ended up
like this.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.830
From now on, you may say

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.290
such things in front of me,

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.820
but keep your mouth shut out there.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.420
You think His Highness doesn't
have enough on his plate already?

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.920
His Highness fought for Susha

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.980
on bloody battlefields.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:13.630
But in the end,

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.190
who appreciates what he's done?

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.800
I shouldn't have let him go
in the first place.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.260
Shouldn't have let him go?

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.720
Would he have listened to you?

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.510
Once His Highness makes a decision,

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.480
who can stop him?

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.270
Back then, it was people from Jinxiu

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.310
who kept trying to assassinate
Miss Yixiao.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.950
But now,

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.160
someone from our Susha Kingdom
wants to kill her,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.390
right under His Highness's nose.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.920
How could he not intervene?

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.800
Others may not understand

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.000
why His Highness did that,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.190
but both of us know clearly

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.920
that he did it just to

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.870
send a message to Prime Minister Zhuang,
Empress Zhuang,

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.130
and everyone else that

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.800
from now on,
anyone who dares lay a hand on Miss Yixiao

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.800
will meet the same fate as Xun Xiang.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.190
I really don't know
whether you're truly clever

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.590
or just pretending to be.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.040
It seems the First Prince

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.560
has completely enraged His Majesty
this time.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.000
Do you think His Majesty's actions

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.800
indicate he intends to appoint Chengyang

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.040
as the Crown Prince?

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.160
His Majesty's mind is hard to read.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.290
It's still too early

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.710
to speculate about that.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.810
However,

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.000
I've already sent people
to spread this matter

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.600
widely outside the palace.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.680
By now, throughout Yujing City,

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.000
I believe everyone has known that
the First Prince

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.660
has lost the Emperor's favor.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.040
In that case,

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:18.510
the situation becomes

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:19.970
even more favorable to us.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.100
That Feng Suige

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.630
is still too young and naive,

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.290
thinking he can challenge us.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.690
How many times have I told you

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:28.600
that Feng Suige

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.440
is not as simple as you imagine.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.360
You mustn't let your guard down.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.920
As for the matter of the ritual,

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.180
it seems to me that he doesn't care
at all.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.310
Father, why do you always
build up others' presence

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.920
at the cost of our own authority?

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.750
In my opinion,

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:42.310
he simply can't let go of

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.370
the grievances his mother suffered,

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.409
thus he keeps looking for ways
to pick fights with us.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.270
Mother!

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:56.880
Greetings, Mother.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.390
Greetings, Grandfather.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.320
Why are you running in such a hurry?

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.210
Look at you, sweating all over.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.920
Be careful not to catch a cold.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.630
Mother,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.160
why has Father suddenly assigned me

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.070
to serve as the secondary officiant
at the Ancestral Ceremony?

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.200
What about Brother?

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.120
Anything happened to him?

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.520
Why do you care about him?

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.930
Just remember this:

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.270
listen to your father

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.680
and don't go against him.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.480
There will be plenty of benefits
for you in the future.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.190
Don't follow your brother's example.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.160
I don't know what Brother

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.530
has done wrong,

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.000
but he's definitely not
that kind of person.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.390
You may see him as your brother,

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.520
but he might not treat you the same way.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:28.760
Don't overthink it.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.560
Your father must have his reasons

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.290
for making such arrangements.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.890
Just listen to your mother.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.450
Don't defy His Majesty

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.230
or make him angry.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:39.870
But according to ancestral tradition,

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:40.630
the role of secondary officiant
at the Ancestral Ceremony

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.490
should be performed by Brother.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:44.090
If I take Brother's place,

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.850
then how will

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:45.870
the court officials

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:46.870
and the citizens of Yujing City

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.130
view him in the future?

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.680
And how will Brother be able to

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.920
hold his head up in Yujing City
after that?

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.000
I'll go ask Father

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.950
to revoke his decree right now.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.800
If you dare to go ask your father that,

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.600
then from now on,

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.260
don't call me Mother anymore!

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.510
Chengyang.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.070
Your mother is doing this
for your own good.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.510
Don't let her down.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:16.690

She wasn't a spy of Jinxiu.

worry about this matter anymore.

of your father?

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.130
He's only asking you to call me "Mother."

You were paying respects to your mother.

I didn't want to disturb you,

see a physician.

Take care.

Is the clue you were talking about here?

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.200
Of course not.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.350
So you deliberately tricked me into
coming here?

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:04.480
There's a Zi'an Lake in Pingling City.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.200
In the past, when I was in a bad mood

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.680

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:09.550
besides practicing archery,

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:10.750
I would find a boat

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:12.960
and lie down in it,

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:14.830
letting it drift on the water,

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:16.290
floating away.

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:17.440
As it drifted,

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.650
all my troubles would drift away too.

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:21.480
Are you remembering things from the past?

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.010
I've been remembering quite a bit,
on and off.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.510
Why are you still standing there?

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:26.440
Come and join me.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.680
I've heard about what happened today.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:58.460
So your father

00:18:58.550 --> 00:18:59.270
really had someone

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:00.880
take your place at the Ancestral Ceremony?

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.540
I don't care about any of that.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:06.400
What you actually care more about is

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.600
your mother's death,

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.920
right?

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:13.110
How did your mother pass away?

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:22.550
If you don't want to talk about it,

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:23.550
you don't have to.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.440
15 years ago,

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.830
Zhuang Shen and his daughter

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:31.630
captured several Jinxiu spies.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.160
Those people actually confessed

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.160
that my mother was also a Jinxiu spy.

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.240
Then her personal maid

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.550
also came forward to testify against her,

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:41.270
claiming that my mother

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:43.310
had secretly met with people from Jinxiu.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.110
All evidence pointed to her.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.210
Is this Her Majesty's letter?

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:52.370
Yes,

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.400
this is indeed Her Majesty's

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.460
letter of treason.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.060
Later, my mother passed away.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:58.550
Those Jinxiu spies

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.250
committed suicide in prison,

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:01.350
and her personal maid

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.350
also died of illness shortly after.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.560
It was all Zhuang Shen
and Empress Zhuang's doing, right?

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:08.820
They were very careful

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:10.830
and destroyed all the evidence.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.200
But I know it must have been them.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.340
If you say so, then it must be true.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.030
Although my hand injury

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:19.480
hasn't completely healed yet,

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.030
within 50 paces,

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:22.920
I can still shoot with perfect accuracy.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:23.850
If you need me to,

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:25.440
I can take the lives of Zhuang Shen

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.840
and his daughter for you.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:32.430
If you kill them now,

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:34.160
my mother will never

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.420
have her name cleared.

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:37.680
You mentioned before

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.920
that your study companions,

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.270
the old nursemaids and others

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:41.610
all betrayed your trust

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.640
and wanted to harm you.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.960
This must also be connected

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.720
to Zhuang Shen and his daughter, right?

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.450
Yes, indeed.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.960
They wanted to get rid of me completely,

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.310
but of course I wouldn't let them
get what they want.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.480
When I was 14,

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.070
I secretly left the imperial palace

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.470
and joined the army
under a false identity.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.270
During those years, everyone

00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:59.730
truly believed I was dead.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.160
From now on, I'll protect you

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.960
and make sure no one can hurt you.

today, the Second Prince spoke up

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:47.680
for Your Highness in court

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.200
and nearly angered His Majesty.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.110
It was only after the senior officials
persuaded him

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:53.400
that he finally accepted the position of
secondary officiant.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.000
When Chengyang learns about

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:56.310
the grudges between me,

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:58.170
his mother, and his grandfather,

00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.830
what will he think?

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:03.400
Don't overthink it.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.720
Nothing can be perfect.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.160
As long as your conscience is clear.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.560
By the way,

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.070
I suddenly remembered some clues

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:12.270
about Meng Junran.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.480
Before falling off the cliff,

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.480
I heard him say

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:16.270
he delivered a batch of silver

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:17.610
to Xia Jingshi.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.920
When will the military funds

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.450
you promised be delivered?

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.400
Yesterday, 100,000 taels of silver

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.480
were already entrusted to

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.590
the Rongtong Escort Agency for transport.

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:27.090
The agency responsible for
escorting that batch of silver

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:29.690
was the Rongtong Escort Agency
of Yujing City.

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.160
I know this escort agency.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.320
They'll take on any escort job,
no matter how risky,

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.790
and they're quite well-known
in Yujing City.

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:36.650
Go investigate

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.240
and find out who sent goods to Xia Jingshi

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.640
through the Rongtong Escort Agency.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.240
Yes.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.880
[Jingming Garden]

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:01.840
Your Highness.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:03.440
Feng Suige will

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.480
attend the Ancestral Ceremony tomorrow.

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.400
I will take this opportunity

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.530
to meet with Wu Ying.

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:11.660
Find a way to notify Wu Ying,

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.500
but make sure no one finds out.

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:14.550
Yes.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.070
Your Highness, please take a look at this.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:18.030
I calculated the time

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:19.110
and made some inquiries.

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.240
Before Miss Yixiao fell off the cliff,

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.200
someone did contact
the Rongtong Escort Agency

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.590
to escort a batch of goods

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:25.120
to Pingling City in Jinxiu.

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:26.550
It was this woman.

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:28.160
Based on the owner's description,

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.880
I had someone draw this portrait.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:30.960
It's just that since it's been too long,

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.310
the owner only remembers vaguely.

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:33.440
It's said this woman

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.890
seemed quite generous,

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:37.110
but she wouldn't let anyone
inquire about her identity.

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:38.240
She said that after arriving in
Pingling City,

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.100
someone would surely be there
to receive the goods.

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:42.720
This woman must have

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.830
some connection with that Meng Junran.

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:45.830
Send more people.

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:47.110
Anyone who bears

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:48.680
even the slightest resemblance
to this portrait—

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.160
investigate them all thoroughly.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.100
Yes.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:58.780
Your Highness,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.330
Junior Marquis is here.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.240
Why is he here?

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:03.310
Why can't I be here?

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:11.330
I didn't want to come,

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:13.160
but I heard from my father

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:16.090
that you got in some bad luck,
so I came to check on you.

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:17.290
I didn't know

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.400
that your father

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.830
could order you around.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.840
If you missed me, just say so.

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:24.260
Don't use your father as an excuse.

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:32.590
I planned to drink with you last night,

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:33.510
but just before leaving,

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:34.310
I suddenly learned that His Majesty

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:36.790
wants me to be some
Imperial Guards' Commander-in-Chief.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:37.770
So I decided I didn't want to see

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:39.100
any of you court people.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.270
It even made me

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:41.530
lose sleep last night.

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:43.830
Isn't that as good as His Majesty
sentencing me to death?

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:44.920
Why did His Majesty suddenly ask you

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.070
to be the Commander-in-Chief
of the Imperial Guards?

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.970
Who knows?

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.330
He said it's to train me.

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:49.880
But you know your father.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.330
What he says and what he thinks

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:52.390
are never the same.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:53.790
Rather than being an official,

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:55.180
I prefer spending time with the beauties
in my mansion,

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.550
traveling and enjoying life.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:57.680
I was thinking of running away

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.440
before the imperial edict

00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.920
was officially issued,

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.220
but then I thought,

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:03.920
if I became the Commander-in-Chief
of the Imperial Guards,

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.580
I'd surely be able to help you.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.590
Don't you do that for me.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.530
I know

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.030
you hate being tied down the most.

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:11.890
Don't say that.

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:13.110
You already have

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:14.640
little influence at court.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:17.480
Now that His Majesty has even had
the Second Prince

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.530
take your place at the Ancestral Ceremony,

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:20.590
how could I leave you behind

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:21.990
and enjoy freedom alone?

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:25.920
So lovey-dovey.

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:28.090
Why don't you two just go get married?

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:29.880
You're jealous, right?

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.480
You're definitely jealous.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.960
The beauty in this portrait is...

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.620
Is it her that you painted?

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.000
Me? Paint her?

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000
No need to hide it.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.400
The one you painted is me.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.620
What's the problem with that?

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:54.110
Right.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:55.650
I did paint you.

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:57.480
How is it?

00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:58.960
Do you like it?

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:00.740
Of course I like it.

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:02.680
My husband painted it for me himself.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.880
I absolutely love it.

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:09.230
I've had enough.

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:10.580
I need to go wash my eyes.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.580
I'm leaving. No need to see me out.

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:19.880
In Yujing City,

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:21.510
whether from noble families

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:22.910
or entertainment boats,

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:24.810
of the women there.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:26.880
With his help,

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.750
our investigation will be much easier.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:29.510
Why didn't you

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:30.670
let me tell him just now?

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:31.760
I just feel

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.380
the fewer people who know about this,
the better.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.110
I have no hostility toward him.

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:37.440
It's just that every time I see him,

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.710
I feel uncomfortable.

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:40.400
I can't explain why.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.100
Could it be that you're really...

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:44.450
Jealous of him?

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.310
Alright.

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:50.770
Come on.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.260
From now on, these secrets

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.050
will be kept between us.

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:00.550
I won't tell anyone else.

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:01.280
Is that okay?

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:05.830
You and Junior Marquis

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:07.110
seem very close.

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.920
I've never seen you
treat anyone like that.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:10.830
Why are you two

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:11.790
so close?

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:15.800
We experienced life and death together.

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:17.510
When we were little, the two of us

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:19.920
went with the Elder Marquis
to inspect the border,

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.030
and we were suddenly attacked
by assassins.

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:24.160
It was thanks to him
and the Elder Marquis

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.480
that I survived.

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.130
No wonder you trust him so much.

This guy

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.920

give up our lives for each other.

Everyone going in and out of here

must be thoroughly checked

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:28.110
the Prince of Zhennan
could disappear, right?

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:29.310
The Prince of Zhennan

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.719
has indeed disappeared.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.330
Brother!

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:30.800
I'm sorry, Brother.

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:33.890
I shouldn't have taken your place
as the secondary officiant.

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:35.420
What are you talking about?

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:37.050
I'm not displeased at all.

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:38.920
Seeing you grown up
and becoming so sensible

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:39.940
makes me happy.

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:41.920
Besides, for my sake,

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.760
you even risked angering His Majesty.

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.110
That proves I still hold

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:46.630
an important place in your heart.

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:47.550
Of course.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:48.570
That being said, between us brothers,

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:50.840
does it matter who serves as
the secondary officiant?

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.560
I'm just worried that those officials

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.810
and the common people

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.510
will gossip about you behind your back.

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:56.630
Then let them be.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.770
You've done nothing wrong,

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:00.430
so you shouldn't feel guilty.

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:05.440
Have you

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.040
grown even taller recently?

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:11.110
It seems I've grown quite a bit indeed.

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:11.740
Suige!

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:14.640
Why are you here?

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.030
While the guards were changing shifts,

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:18.630
Xia Jingshi slipped out
through the back door.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.130
Wu Ying pays respect to Your Eminence.

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:33.800
[Wu Ying from the death camp]

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.930
In enemy territory,

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.700
one must act with caution in all matters.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:38.420
One careless moment

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.420
could leave you dead with no burial.

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:41.400
You've remained undercover until now

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.400
without Susha detecting anything.

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:44.610
Good job.

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:47.190
Thank you, Your Eminence.

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:49.160
After the wedding,

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:50.920
I'll find a way to leave Yujing.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:52.240
While I'm not here,

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:53.460
you'll lead our men

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:54.990
and coordinate with Susha.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.340
Take this

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:01.030
and make contact at the alley
behind the dance house.

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.890
Your Eminence,

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:02.630
why must we

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:04.760
risk our lives for those Susha people?

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:09.000
I spoke out of turn.

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:18.400
[Jingming Garden]

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.800
So that's what happened.

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:21.710
You couldn't even keep watch
over one person.

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:22.830
If His Lordship blames us,

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:23.480
none of you can escape punishment!

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:24.150
And you all!

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:25.550
On my very first day in office,

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:26.960
you already embarrassed me.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:27.670
And you too!

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.540
He's back.

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:47.690
[Jingming Garden]

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.570
Where have you been?

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.840
Why should I report to you

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.230
where I went?

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:57.960
Who did you just meet?

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:01.960
I felt stifled in there,
so I went for a walk.

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:02.820
Well, I came to Susha

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:03.820
for the marriage alliance,

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:04.840
not as a hostage.

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:06.320
First Prince, it seems
you're in no position

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.880
to restrict my freedom, are you?

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.480
I was just worried about you.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.500
If you were careless

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.810
and died on some street out there,

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.040
that would be bad.

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:18.040
Are you threatening me?

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:20.880
So what if he is?

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:23.480
In Jinxiu, you're the Prince of Zhennan.

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.070
But here, you're nothing more than

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:25.110
a son-in-law marrying into
the royal family.

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:25.630
Yao.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:29.240
Speak more respectfully to
the Prince of Zhennan.

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:30.480
[Jingming Garden]

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.640
From today on,

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.890
without my written order,

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:34.900
no one is to leave his side
even for a moment.

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.160
If he slips away again,

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:37.880
I'll have your heads.

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:39.320
Yes, My Lord!

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:40.590
Escort him back to his residence.

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:42.850
[Jingming Garden]

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.090
[Jingming Garden]

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:56.820
How was that?

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.580
Was my authority convincing?

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:01.110
Make sure you keep a close eye on him.

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:02.070
Rest assured.

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:08.090
[Jingming Garden]

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.530
That was obviously a dead-end valley,

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:17.160
but when I caught up,

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:19.010
Xia Jingshi had vanished.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:20.630
Later, I searched

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:22.560
all the nearby streets and alleys,

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:23.710
but still couldn't find

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:24.640
any trace of him.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.580
It's my incompetence.

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:29.930
Please punish me, Your Highness.

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:33.720
It's not your fault.

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:35.590
Xia Jingshi's escape this time

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:36.710
wasn't an accident.

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:38.310
He planned it in advance.

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:39.360
Someone must have been

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.020
helping him from the outside.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.930
But with the wedding approaching,

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:45.280
why would Xia Jingshi

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.160
choose to take a risk at such a timing?

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.760
Besides, what could he have done

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:49.890
in such a short time?

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:51.280
Or perhaps...

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:53.560
He went to meet someone?

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:57.490
Your Highness!

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:00.840
Your Highness.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:01.510
Any news?

00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:02.150
Yes.

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:03.650
I checked every woman

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:04.780
who resembles the one

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:05.510
in the portrait

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:06.240
and is of similar age

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.400
throughout Yujing City,

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.090
and I finally pinpointed

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:09.670
a top performer in the dance house
named Ruyan.

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:10.360
She must be the one

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.360
we're looking for.

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.620
Prepare the carriage.

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:14.910
I'll go see for myself.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.310
Drink a bit more.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.360
Can't you let me take a break?

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.920
If the medicine gets cold,

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.180
it'll lose its effect.

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.820
Father, drink it while it's warm.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.150
Father,

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.460
what's this medicine you're taking?

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:34.440
Father, are you unwell?

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:37.150
Why haven't I

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:39.610
heard anything from the Imperial Hospital?

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:41.070
Does Mother

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:42.070
know about this?

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:43.400
Allow me to take a break.

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:45.270
I'll drink it later.

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:46.290
These are

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.100
just some calming medicines.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.960
My child.

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:53.110
How come you're showing me

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:54.510
such filial piety today?

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:56.400
My wedding day is approaching.

00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:59.670
I'm reluctant to leave you, Father.

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:02.510
What's there to be reluctant about?

00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:03.190
You're just marrying

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:04.710
the Prince of Zhennan, aren't you?

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:05.400
Besides,

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.090
you won't be far from me,

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:08.450
so why the reluctance?

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.880
But still, I can't always be

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:12.010
by your and Mother's side to serve you.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.070
Could it be that

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:15.760
you don't like having me by your side,
Father?

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:16.560
Of course I do.

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:18.550
How could I not?

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:20.230
Then why did you say all that?

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:26.160
I just

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:29.360
don't want you to worry.

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:32.150
Remember,

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:34.700
after you're married,

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.250
no matter what happens,

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:38.320
you must let me know.

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.070
I'll always be your support.

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.710
The entire Susha

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.230
is your support.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:45.980
Do you understand?

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.120
I understand.

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.460
Thank you, Father.

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:53.150
Well, I won't drink this.

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:54.680
Give me a massage, will you?

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.330
Remember to drink it later.

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.150
All right.

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.880
Daughters are the best.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:06.710
Your Majesty.

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.960
[Su]

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.320
The token has been retrieved.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:09.550
Shall I put it back to its original place?

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:11.980
[Su]

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:14.580
Yes, put it back.

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:17.080
Your Highness.

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:18.550
His Majesty hasn't been

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:20.160
this happy for many days.

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.670
Forgive me for speaking out of turn again.

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:23.840
I shall take my leave now.

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.370
Thank you for your service.

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:30.500
Father, if you're tired,
