(Kindred Spirits)

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.120
- Mr. Lin!
- Mr. Lin!

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.240
Mr. Lin, are you okay?

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.600
- Mr. Lin!
- Mr. Lin!

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.520
What's wrong, Mr. Lin?

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.680
Mr. Lin.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.920
What happened, Mr. Lin?

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.400
Mr. Lin, are you alright?

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.200
Say something.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.760
Mr. Lin, please speak.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.240
Exactly.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.840
Mr. Lin, please speak.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.720
What's going on?

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.840
Well...

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.360
I...

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.360
I never believed in stories before.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.720
But just now,

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.160
I had a dream.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.680
A dream?

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.840
A very long dream.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.880
Like living an entirely different life.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.520
Yet when I woke up,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.680
everything vanished.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.440
You just said

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.920
that this was a business strategy game
about managing a tea estate.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.160
But what I want to tell you is,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.440
this is a game about love.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.480
Love?

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.720
At first, I also thought

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.400
it was about business rivalry.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.680
But gradually, I realized

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.040
it's actually about two people

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.400
discovering themselves

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.800
and finding the guiding light
within their hearts.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.600
Perhaps

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.400
only through the warm story

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.120
can we

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.400
dissect this cold material world.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.400
Mr. Lin.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.520
Let's take a photo of you.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.200
- Mr. Lin, please.
- Mr. Lin, please.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.280
Mr. Lin, don't leave!
Say a few more words!

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.040
- Mr. Lin.
- Mr. Lin.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.000
(Should Li Zixuan go find Wei Xiaotang?)

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.440
Long time no see.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.720
(With kindred spirits,)

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.120
(we keep our promise.)

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.200
(Whatever happens,)

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.200
(we work hand in hand.)

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.360
(From this moment on,)

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.840
(you and I are in the same boat.)

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.240
(Winning the Top Tea title)

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.000
(is good for us both.)

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.000
But if we earn the Top Tea title,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.080
you'll leave.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.880
Since she can come to this world
and meet you,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.680
you can go to her world too.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.800
(Li Zixuan.)

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.400
(Make a wish too.)

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.720
(I pray)

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.600
(that Wei Xiaotang and I
may stay together forever.)

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.080
(If one day)

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.960
(you have to leave,)

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.880
(please let me)

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.120
(find you in your world.)

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.040
(Do you know you're late?)

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.960
(If you want to meet someone,)

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.720
(there's always a way.)

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.440
(Whatever happens,)

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.800
(we work hand in hand.)

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.040
My dear, do you think

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.400
we're living a life

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.840
or a dream?

00:08:21.056 --> 00:08:22.666
(In the sixth year of the Yuanfeng era,
after taking a nap,)

00:08:22.666 --> 00:08:23.872
(Wei Xiaotang realized
she wasn't a woman)

00:08:23.872 --> 00:08:25.222
(but a man named Lin Yuhao
from another world.)

00:08:25.222 --> 00:08:27.122
(Determined, she sought to return
to her own world.)

00:08:27.122 --> 00:08:29.542
(Her tale defied belief,
yet her wisdom proved true.)

00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:31.488
(Her unconventional ways
often stunned people.)

00:08:31.488 --> 00:08:33.492
(She pioneered tea arts,
popularized milk tea,)

00:08:33.492 --> 00:08:34.872
(and changed
the Li family's old traditions.)

00:08:34.872 --> 00:08:35.962
(Thus, she united hearts and minds,
turning evil to good in the end.)

00:08:35.962 --> 00:08:37.912
(Everything went smoothly.)

00:08:37.912 --> 00:08:39.522
(Li Zixuan was a devoted husband.)

00:08:39.522 --> 00:08:41.504
(Though he loved Xiaotang, he finally
let Xiaotang go back to her world.)

00:08:41.504 --> 00:08:43.742
(Upon returning, Lin Yuhao
shared his story with outsiders.)

00:08:43.742 --> 00:08:45.522
(As he finished speaking,
Li Zixuan showed up before him.)

00:08:45.522 --> 00:08:48.032
(Suddenly, Wei Xiaotang appeared again.)

00:08:48.032 --> 00:08:51.328
(Xiaotang came to Lin Yuhao's dream, not
that Yuhao became her in his dream.)

00:08:52.192 --> 00:08:55.968
(The End)

00:08:56.128 --> 00:08:57.472
(Got you again!)

00:08:57.523 --> 00:08:59.360
(Next comes a Q&A session.)

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.864
(Do you like this TV series? Yes or No.)
