Quite independent.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.600
She asked me if I'd ever seen her
somewhere before.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.933
Is she an influencer or something?

00:14:55.933 --> 00:14:57.100
Ah, no way.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.200
'No way'.

She's clearly a nasty woman, right?

But I couldn't find the name 'Bu Se Mi'.

00:20:51.967 --> 00:20:55.333
It's just because she's not a popular influencer.

It's obvious now that
she's like a guy-version Tae Min.

- Pardon?
- Should I bring it in for you?

No, it's fine. I'll take it.

If we can't find a teacher this time either,

Muchang Kindergarten itself
will shut down next year.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:13.533
Then, our kids will have to ride the shuttle bus
for over an hour to get out.

Our jobs will disappear too.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.400
Exactly.

If Seong Tae uses cash bribes,

Speaking from my experience living in Seoul,

00:32:55.033 --> 00:32:58.900
Seoul people tend to be wary
if someone is overly kind for no reason.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.200

No, that's...

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.933
- the handover...
- The handover

00:40:54.933 --> 00:40:57.700
wasn't properly done, so we made a mistake.

00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.867
'A dog that's bitten once tends to bite again.'

00:40:59.867 --> 00:41:02.433
Attorney Lee, calling me a dog? That's Cheol Su.

00:41:02.433 --> 00:41:03.433
Oh, are you talking to me?

00:41:03.433 --> 00:41:04.433
You called me a dog?

00:41:04.433 --> 00:41:07.367
Attorney Lee, I won't bite again.

00:41:07.367 --> 00:41:10.300
Wait, I'll pull out my fangs.

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:11.867
I've added some severance pay.

00:41:11.867 --> 00:41:14.167
- Take this at least.
- Thank you.

00:41:15.233 --> 00:41:16.833
Wait.

00:41:18.233 --> 00:41:19.667
Butler.

00:41:19.667 --> 00:41:21.400
Yang Cheol Su.

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.333
Listen carefully from now on.

00:41:24.333 --> 00:41:27.833
I listened to you and ended up like this.

00:41:27.833 --> 00:41:29.133
Ah, our Hye Ji.

00:41:29.133 --> 00:41:31.567
Hye Ji said she has 100 million in savings.

00:41:32.467 --> 00:41:35.767
I know who we should turn to.

00:41:35.767 --> 00:41:37.500
Who is that?

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:39.133
Who else?

00:41:39.133 --> 00:41:40.533
The professor.

00:41:40.533 --> 00:41:43.733
She must have a plan.

00:41:47.367 --> 00:41:49.752
Wait, wait. Wait for me.

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:31.133
Only my back hurts.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.767
Wow, chicken.

00:42:47.767 --> 00:42:50.333
I'll stay here until Madam returns.

00:42:50.333 --> 00:42:52.700
Act like you're invisible, Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:54.700
Attorney Lee, have you eaten?

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:56.067
Didn't I tell you?

00:42:56.067 --> 00:42:59.667
'Leave the cooking to the chef,
and the chicken to the chicken shop.'

00:42:59.667 --> 00:43:02.367
Don't want homemade food?

00:43:02.367 --> 00:43:04.167
This isn't my home.

00:43:04.167 --> 00:43:05.433
Ah, one more thing,

00:43:05.433 --> 00:43:09.300
stay out of the main house
except during meals, Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:10.433
Alright.

00:43:10.433 --> 00:43:13.200
Attorney, you know, um...

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:19.267
Where exactly is Madam?

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:24.033
Why should I have to explain that
to you, Ms. Baek Hye Ji?

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:28.300
Because Madam and I are friends.
You little troublemaker.

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:31.033
Have you heard from Professor Ga Seon Yeong?

00:43:31.833 --> 00:43:32.867
No.

00:43:32.867 --> 00:43:37.867
If Professor Ga approaches you even once,
tell me immediately, Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

00:43:38.633 --> 00:43:40.267
Okay.

00:43:41.333 --> 00:43:45.233
Yes... Why do I have to tell you?

00:43:45.233 --> 00:43:48.333
Listen to people until the end.

00:43:48.333 --> 00:43:49.933
Hmph.

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.500
Muchang must be peaceful, right?

00:44:51.333 --> 00:44:53.400
Dong Min, did you talk with the teacher yesterday?

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:57.200
Does she prefer spicy red ramyeon? Or mild?

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.833
Don't know.

00:45:00.233 --> 00:45:03.100
Do you think she likes soju? Or beer?

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:05.733
Wait, she probably prefers wine. Right?

00:45:05.733 --> 00:45:07.133
No idea.

00:45:07.133 --> 00:45:09.467
Ugh, you two barely talked.

00:45:09.467 --> 00:45:11.233
No progress at all.

00:45:11.233 --> 00:45:13.233
She hates bean rice. Bean rice!

00:45:13.233 --> 00:45:16.167
Whoa, how'd you figure that out? Impressive.

00:45:16.167 --> 00:45:18.300
Did things already move forward?

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:21.667
Jeez. What could a single guy like you even know?

00:45:23.833 --> 00:45:26.333
We even changed the strawberry variety
using the agricultural loan.

00:45:26.333 --> 00:45:29.100
Why are the seedlings so wilted?

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:30.333
Hey, guys.

00:45:30.333 --> 00:45:31.767
You need to grow big and strong.

00:45:31.767 --> 00:45:35.100
So Ju Won can go to cram school
and learn piano. Right?

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.733
Don't you agree?

00:45:37.933 --> 00:45:41.333
Don't worry, Uncle Dong Min. We'll strike it rich.

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:43.867
Another new spirit.

00:45:46.033 --> 00:45:48.867
Hey, I'll go wake Ju Won, okay?

00:45:49.767 --> 00:45:51.800
Seriously.

00:45:52.733 --> 00:45:54.800
But,

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:58.500
strawberries won't make us rich.

00:46:04.767 --> 00:46:06.933
They're sweet! Sweet.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.967
Uncle Dong Min's an idiot.

00:46:12.567 --> 00:46:14.433
When did you get here?

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:30.967
Oh, hi.

00:46:30.967 --> 00:46:32.367
- Hello, Ju Won.
- There you go.

00:46:32.367 --> 00:46:34.167
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:46:34.167 --> 00:46:36.300
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:38.467
Jeon Ju Won, listen to your teacher.

00:46:38.467 --> 00:46:40.467
- Okay.
- We're late.

00:46:40.467 --> 00:46:42.067
See you.

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:50.833
Ms. Bu Se Mi.

00:46:50.833 --> 00:46:53.733
This is Lee Mi Seon,
Principal of Iseon Kindergarten.

00:46:53.733 --> 00:46:58.033
I've been preoccupied
with the academic conference.

00:46:58.033 --> 00:47:00.867
Due to kindergarten circumstances,
we need you to start teaching immediately.

00:47:00.867 --> 00:47:04.533
Please arrive by 8:30 AM.

00:47:04.533 --> 00:47:05.867
Dong Min. Dong Min.

00:47:05.867 --> 00:47:08.467
- Yes?
- How is she?

00:47:08.467 --> 00:47:11.000
Don sent her all the way to the kindergarten.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.700
I feel like he's subtly
trying to introduce her to me.

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:14.933
Introduce her?

00:47:14.933 --> 00:47:17.767
He wants me to vet her as his potential match.

00:47:17.767 --> 00:47:20.967
Top education, good family background.
Perfect for Don, right?

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.267
Then do a thorough background check, sis.

00:47:24.267 --> 00:47:26.967
People fake degrees and careers these days, right?

00:47:26.967 --> 00:47:31.367
Check her past workplaces for any incidents.

00:47:31.367 --> 00:47:32.467
Dong Min.

00:47:32.467 --> 00:47:33.667
You don't know who I am?

00:47:33.667 --> 00:47:34.867
Lee Mi Seon.

00:47:34.867 --> 00:47:36.667
Already verified everything.

00:47:39.933 --> 00:47:41.733
I'm heading to work first.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:55.900
Hello, children.

00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:58.733
I'm Ms. Bu Se Mi.

00:47:58.733 --> 00:48:00.800
Hello, children.

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.733
I'm Ms. Bu Se Mi.

00:48:03.733 --> 00:48:05.367
Okay.

00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:11.633
Yes.

00:48:11.633 --> 00:48:14.033
I'd like to inquire about installing CCTV.

00:48:14.033 --> 00:48:15.867
Can it be done today?

00:48:15.867 --> 00:48:17.700
Money isn't an issue.

00:48:29.167 --> 00:48:31.500
Hey, is this Kim Yeong Ran?

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:32.867
Yes, correct.

00:48:32.867 --> 00:48:35.967
We verified multiple times
through airport CCTV footage.

00:48:35.967 --> 00:48:37.333
Then, where is she now?

00:48:37.333 --> 00:48:38.400
We're tracking her.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.200
Seoul's CCTV isn't accessible to everyone.

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:43.333
It's challenging to trace her.

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:47.167
Wow, unbelievable.

00:48:47.167 --> 00:48:49.100
What is she doing in the meantime?

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:52.800
Professor, Lee Don changed the will's
release date to the shareholders' meeting.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:55.367
All heirs must attend.

00:48:55.367 --> 00:48:58.000
We need to obtain it before then.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.533
I already checked all bank VIP vaults.

00:49:00.533 --> 00:49:04.500
No traces under the chairman's name,
Lee Don's, or anyone else's.

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:07.167
Ga Sung Ho trusts no one.

00:49:07.167 --> 00:49:09.033
He probably kept it at home.

00:49:10.067 --> 00:49:11.767
Contact Prosecutor Kim.

00:49:11.767 --> 00:49:14.233
Pin any charge on Lee Don
to drag him out of his house.

00:49:14.233 --> 00:49:15.867
Yes, Professor.

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:24.300
I love these photos. Send me the best ones.

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:26.767
We should file a missing person report.

00:49:26.767 --> 00:49:29.200
Mom left home.

00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:33.700
Should her children just stay silent?

[Resume]

00:50:13.733 --> 00:50:17.133
You've done a lot of volunteer work abroad?

00:50:17.133 --> 00:50:20.100
Both my parents were active volunteers.

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:22.400
I think I inherited that from them.

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:26.767
Exactly. Family background matters.

00:50:26.767 --> 00:50:28.733
But with credentials like yours, Ms. Bu Se Mi,

00:50:28.733 --> 00:50:32.333
you could've easily gotten into
Iseon Women's University Affiliated Kindergarten.

00:50:32.333 --> 00:50:34.200
Ah...

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:38.200
Why did you come all the way to Muchang?

00:50:39.933 --> 00:50:42.167
I'm about to

00:50:42.167 --> 00:50:44.667
tell you the reason now.

00:50:49.333 --> 00:50:52.367
Since childhood, I followed my professor father

00:50:52.367 --> 00:50:54.433
living abroad at times.

00:50:54.433 --> 00:50:57.833
During college breaks, I volunteered in Africa

00:50:57.833 --> 00:51:02.167
and realized education's crucial importance.

00:51:02.167 --> 00:51:03.633
Then I heard about

00:51:03.633 --> 00:51:08.867
a principal in Muchang embodying Iseon's spirit.

00:51:08.867 --> 00:51:12.967
I desperately wanted to teach children here.

00:51:14.167 --> 00:51:18.133
You're exactly the teacher we've been waiting for.

00:51:18.133 --> 00:51:20.833
And arriving just before orientation,

00:51:20.833 --> 00:51:24.633
we're so fortunate to have
someone like you, Ms. Bu Se Mi.

00:51:26.667 --> 00:51:30.133
Shall we see the classrooms now?

00:51:30.133 --> 00:51:32.367
The children will arrive by shuttle soon.

00:51:32.367 --> 00:51:33.933
You can leave your bag here.

00:51:33.933 --> 00:51:37.200
Muchang is a safe place.

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:40.600
This way.

00:51:41.633 --> 00:51:43.767
Our Muchang Iseon Kindergarten

00:51:43.767 --> 00:51:45.867
is the most prestigious in the area.

00:51:45.867 --> 00:51:49.167
Many children commute from far away.

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:54.967
Aren't they adorable?

00:51:55.867 --> 00:51:58.267
Principal! Where are you?

00:51:58.267 --> 00:51:59.700
Come out and talk to me.

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:03.633
Oh my, what's going on this morning?

00:52:03.633 --> 00:52:05.900
Miss, the Strawberry Class is at the far end.

00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:07.800
Please go ahead first.

00:52:08.633 --> 00:52:10.267
What's this?

00:52:10.267 --> 00:52:12.333
How many times have I said
I won't renew the contract next year...

00:52:12.333 --> 00:52:13.367
Please calm down.

00:52:13.367 --> 00:52:15.533
Wait in the Apple Class.

00:52:15.533 --> 00:52:17.833
Go inside. To the Apple Class.

00:52:17.833 --> 00:52:19.333
Go in.

00:52:19.333 --> 00:52:21.167
Go in.

00:52:25.867 --> 00:52:28.300
The owner of this land
is nearing the end of his life.

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:31.133
And his kids promised to sell me this land.

00:52:31.133 --> 00:52:32.867
I'll pay the full deposit tomorrow.

00:52:32.867 --> 00:52:36.933
I'm going to bulldoze this garden and playground

00:52:36.933 --> 00:52:38.033
and build a nursing home.

00:52:38.033 --> 00:52:40.233
Seong Tae.

00:52:40.233 --> 00:52:41.700
Did you tear this?

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:43.333
Yes.

00:52:44.033 --> 00:52:45.700
Seong Tae.

00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:47.467
If this kindergarten closes,

00:52:47.467 --> 00:52:51.433
kids will spend hours commuting by bus.

00:52:51.433 --> 00:52:55.067
But Principal, you know what?

00:52:55.067 --> 00:52:58.900
Soon there'll be more elders needing nursing homes

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:01.667
