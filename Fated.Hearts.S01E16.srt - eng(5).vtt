[Episode 16]

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.039
Although your hand injury
can heal completely,

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.560
it won't get better

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.759
in just a day or two.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.000
As for lifting heavy things,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.229
let others do it for you.

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.840
And archery is absolutely forbidden.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.900
Do you understand?

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.720
I understand.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.790
It's all my father's fault.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.280
If he had come to Yujing earlier,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.840
your hand injury

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.970
wouldn't have been delayed until now.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.139
Lord Ling helped me save Ning Fei

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.539
and treated my injury.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.360
I am so thankful

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.710
for such great kindness.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.910
How could I blame him?

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.310
By the way,

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.920
is there any news about Ning Fei?

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:19.079
I asked my father.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.590
He told me not to inquire.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.800
He said the person has been delivered

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.660
and will naturally receive help.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.560
Sister.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:26.820
Don't worry.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.750
As soon as there's any news,

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.280
I'll tell you immediately.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.560
By the way,

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.829
when are you leaving?

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.160
Leaving?

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.430
Heading where?

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.480
Leaving Susha.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.520
Since you already know

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.829
Xia Jingshi was the one
who wanted to harm you

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:40.430
and have completely

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.630
severed ties with him,

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.290
why stay in Yujing any longer?

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.470
My father is urging me
to return to Zhengnian Villa.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.950
Why don't you come with me?

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.560
I've asked Shunzi and the others.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.430
As long as you agree,

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.090
they're willing

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.590
to return to Zhengnian Villa with me.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.390
Since we've become sworn sisters,

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.360
and are now family,

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.300
you'll be just like me.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.910
We'll both be Young Young Mistresses.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.800
If that doesn't work,

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.280
I can ask my father
to adopt you as his goddaughter.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.140
That way you'll have a family too.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:02.430
Thank you.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:03.960
So you agree?

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.680
But I promised Feng Suige

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.800
to help him

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.260
find the traitor in Susha.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.360
That's Feng Suige's business.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.870
You've helped him enough already.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.120
I’m still shaken by

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.750
the previous assassination attempt on you.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.840
Aren't you afraid

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.579
to continue staying here?

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.440
Don't worry,

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.100
I can protect myself.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.860
You haven't fallen for him, have you?

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.010
What are you talking about?

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.630
I just feel that

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:29.810
your attitude toward Feng Suige

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.270
is different than before.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.430
You said you were just using each other,

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.760
but now you're practically inseparable.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.380
We just have important matters to discuss.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.680
You discuss things during the day,

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.000
you discuss things over the night.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.530
Are there really
that many things to discuss?

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.350
Miss Yixiao,

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.920
someone is here for you.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.520
His Highness sent me to fetch you.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.980
He says he has important matters
to discuss.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.430
Sister.

[Lotus Pavilion]

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.000
Long time no see.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.460
-Come in.
-Please come in.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.620
Young Master, come in and have a seat.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.650
Come again, young Master.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.380
Your Highness.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.950
Young Master, come in and take a look.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:28.810
Why are we here?

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.390
The person who delivered silver to Xia Jingshi

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.230
through the Rongtong Escort Agency

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.070
is most likely a dancer here

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.560
named Ruyan.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.830
What's wrong?

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.650
You go in first. I'll be right back.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.570
Young Master, come in and have a seat.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.340
Come, please step inside.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.460
Are you alone, Young Master?

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.550
Could you please ask

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.470
for Miss Ruyan for me?

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.240
Ruyan already has an appointment today.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.270
Why not let me

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.490
keep you company for a few drinks?

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.480
May I ask who

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.430
has an appointment with Miss Ruyan?

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.630
Young Master Murong.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.000
Miss Linglan.

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.670
Sui...

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:41.470
Suige?

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.680
What are you doing here?

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.240
I thought you

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.970
don't come to places like this.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.290
What's going on?

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.470
Why did you come here?

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.270
Didn't I ask you to watch the villa?

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.159
Don't worry, I've arranged everything.

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.750
Even the servants,

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.920
I've replaced them with my own people.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.750
If anything happens,

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.550
I'll know about it immediately.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.630
You... I really...

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.190
I'm not interfering with your business.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.050
Think about it,

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.190
I can't just stand guard

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.360
at the villa entrance every day, can I?

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.830
Then wouldn't I have just

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.690
become nothing but a doorkeeper?

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.790
Don't worry.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.330
Miss Linglan.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.340
Haven’t seen you in a few days
and you’ve gotten prettier!

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.080
Thank you.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.240
Where is your sister?

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.040
She is waiting for you upstairs.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.950
No wonder they say you're lucky.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.070
It took me half a month of waiting

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.560
before I finally

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.680
secured a meeting with Miss Ruyan.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.340
You're much luckier than I am.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.520
I'm going now.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.600
Let's go. Since you're already here.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.920
Let me tell you, her dancing is really...

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.840
Miss Ruyan.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:49.510
This is

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.120
my best friend since childhood.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.850
He's a rare and honoured guest.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.860
Make sure he's well taken care of.

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:57.040
Young Master, you look distinguished.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.640
Surely a man of great talent.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.820
Please enjoy yourselves, gentlemen.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.090
I'll go change into my attire.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.040
Go ahead.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.360
That won't be necessary.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.270
I didn't come here today

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.800
to enjoy music and dancing.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.830
No need to change your clothes.

Then what brings you here?

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.090
I have something to ask you.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.330
Come.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.560
No need to be formal.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.090
Sit down.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.810
Sit down. It's fine.

has to ask you

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.430
and just answer truthfully.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:24.950
Yes.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:26.870
What?

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.450
You need to leave first.

Me? Leave?

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.780
Why should I leave?

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.430
Don't ask about things

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.290
you shouldn't.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.240
What secrets

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.280
could you two be hiding?

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.600
Didn't you just tell me

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:39.600
that you've never met her before?

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.560
Isn't this your first time here?

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.140
You lied to me, did you?

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.000
Get out.

with Miss Ruyan.

Rongtong Escort Agency?

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.000
Young Master, you come to my dance house

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.260
not to enjoy the dance

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.240
but to ask about the escort agency?

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.240
Did you have Rongtong Escort Agency

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.550
deliver something to Pingling City
in Jinxiu?

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:19.360
Yes, I did.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.060
What was delivered

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.000
and to whom?

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.030
That I don't know.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.390
Young Master, please don't glare at me.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.840
You're scaring me.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.140
Please tell me the truth, Miss Ruyan.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.920
I was entrusted by a patron

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
to arrange a delivery
with the escort agency.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.790
But in our line of work,

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.200
we avoid asking questions.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.530
So what was delivered and to whom,

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.110
I didn't ask at all.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:46.600
Then this patron,

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.630
who is he?

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.100
Young Master.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.870
If I reveal his name,

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.030
I won't be able to survive
in Yujing City anymore.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.440
Please stop asking, Young Master.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.510
I won't tell you.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.600
Miss Ruyan, I'm afraid you don't know that

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.730
if you don't tell me,

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.000
the consequences will be

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.670
a thousand times worse.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:06.840
The last time

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.170
I broke someone's neck,

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.420
I didn't apply the right technique.

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:11.320
So it caused that person

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.930
to take an hour to die.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.980
The pain was unbearable.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.960
Who are you really, Young Master?

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.360
You folks are well-informed here.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.840
Surely you've heard about

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.100
who had their neck broken in Yujing City?

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:27.510
You are...

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:29.850
The First Prince?

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.670
Miss Ruyan, I ask that

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:33.120
you tell me the truth.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.820
The person who hired me that day

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.840
was Manager Luo from Changsheng Bank.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.640
He was too drunk to walk that day,

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.030
and was afraid
of delaying important business,

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.270
so he asked me to visit the escort agency.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:45.960
He even gave me some silver as payment.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.600
As for what the goods were,

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:48.830
I have no idea.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.240
I swear to heaven.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:50.910
I was just running errands

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.150
and delivering messages for him.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:53.720
If there was anything wrong
with the goods,

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.920
it has absolutely nothing to do with me.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.630
I swear to heaven.

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.390
There's not a single lie
in what I've said,

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:03.120
or else,

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.570
may I die of festering sores

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:06.100
and never be reincarnated.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:26.670
Good.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:27.810
Nice performance.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:31.890
Let's go.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.270
What is your reason

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:36.120
for looking for Miss Ruyan?

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.470
What is it that I can't know about?

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:38.900
It's none of your business.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.670
That won't do.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:40.630
If it concerns Miss Ruyan,

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:41.760
then it concerns me.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.150
I just wanted to ask Miss Ruyan

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:45.110
some questions.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.320
It really has nothing to do with you.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.630
Where are you going?

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.980
You don't know how to treat a lady.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.380
You must have scared her.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.120
-I need to comfort her.
-His Majesty entrusted

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.150
the Imperial Guards to you.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:57.570
Such an important responsibility
given to you,

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:58.120
and here you are

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.400
chasing after women.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:00.970
And in broad daylight too.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:01.790
As if you're afraid people don't know

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:02.730
who you are.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:03.390
Yes.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.880
Then I'll come back after dark.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.190
I really want to kick you to death.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.410
You're bluffing. You wouldn't bear to.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:11.670
Just let me say a word to her.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:12.670
Comfort her a bit.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.100
Go, go, go.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.150
The Junior Marquis hasn't changed a bit

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:19.320
over all these years.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.840
Just playing around for fun.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.750
Nobody can control him.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:22.550
Go and bring Manager Luo

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.190
from Changsheng Bank

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:25.720
to meet me immediately.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:26.360
Wait.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:28.180
Where's Yixiao?

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.310
Why hasn't she returned yet?

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:30.440
She said to let you go in first.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.550
It shouldn't take too long.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:32.430
It's been an incense stick's time already.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.030
Why hasn't she come back yet?

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.140
Don't worry about me.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.000
Go find Manager Luo immediately.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:38.670
Hurry up.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.190
Following me all the way here.

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:51.320
Didn't you consider

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.180
that I deliberately led you here?

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.550
It seems all the skills I taught you

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:00.410
have been completely forgotten.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.240
Fu Yixiao.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:17.840
All of you

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.790
carry deep blood feuds.

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.400
You have no family, no ties.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:22.150
Your lives

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.020
are as cheap as ants.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.120
If you wish to survive here,

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.000
you must become

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.600
the bravest death warriors.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.320
You...

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:39.920
You're still alive.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.200
What?

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.390
Hoping I was dead?

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.550
I treated you well back then.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:37.880
How would the hideout of the death camp

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.200
not have any traps,

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.260
allowing strangers to enter freely?

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:42.880
You were too careless.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.000
Muscle-weakening incense.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.050
It won't kill you.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.480
It only makes your entire body

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.830
weak and powerless.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:51.920
Be good.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.480
Don't resist.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.640
Why are you still alive?

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:00.750
Naturally because of His Highness.

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:04.110
It was His Highness who gave me

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:05.370
the chance to survive.

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:09.280
His Highness...

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:17.630
As for you.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:20.190
If His Highness hadn't saved you
back then,

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.680
how could you have survived until today?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.200
Not only are you ungrateful,

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.130
you're even thinking of betrayal.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.640
How is that possible?

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.600
How could it be His Highness?

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.980
He clearly told me

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.150
that the death camp

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:42.890
had been completely eliminated.

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:47.470
The death camp belongs to His Highness.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.880
Why would anyone

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.200
eliminate their own power base?

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.550
If His Highness hadn't said

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:57.920
the death camp was completely eliminated,

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.000
how could you have spent all these years

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.510
being so devoted to him?

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.640
If I could expose myself,

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.910
I would have killed you

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:13.110
on the day you entered Yujing.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:14.240
I wouldn't need those undercover guards

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.970
from His Highness' Residence.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:41.350
Yixiao.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.440
Yixiao.

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.630
If you want to kill me, then do it.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:59.510
Go ahead.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.400
I can't kill you.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:03.920
If I kill you,

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:06.030
His Highness would surely blame me.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.380
But His Highness won't expect

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.560
that you come here today.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.790
So...

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:14.390
Rest assured.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.960
I'll make you die silently,

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.350
leaving no trace.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.680
Save me!

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:55.830
Please save me!

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.640
Help!

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:08.990
Hold on!

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:10.230
I'll get you out.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:11.640
Hold on!

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:15.880
Save me!

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.280
Hold on!

Previously, Xia Jingshi

mentioned in his notes given to me

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:43.680
that after he rescued me

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.270
from the death camp,

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:46.260
the death camp had already

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.680

who released her back then.
