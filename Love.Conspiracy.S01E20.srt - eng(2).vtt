00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:27.620
Who is it?

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.100
Look at this mess.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.340
You've had so much to drink.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.140
What are you doing here?

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.900
Just leave it there. Stop cleaning up.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.740
If I don't clean,

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.380
will you do it?

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.420
Look at the state you're in.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.100
If I don't drink,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.380
what else am I supposed to do?

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.860
I told you

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.140
to stop cleaning up!

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.900
I'm fine.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.980
Alright.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.260
You want to drink?

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.940
I'll drink with you.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.140
Come on, Wenhan.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.260
I've worked myself to the bone
all these years,

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.540
and in the end, I've lost everything.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.820
I just don't know what to do.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.620
All I wanted

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.420
was for you to grow up happily

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.500
and for us to live a normal, simple life

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.180
like a regular family.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.460
But now it seems

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.140
it's too late for all that.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.220
I came today

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.580
because I wanted to be here for you.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.900
I missed you.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.900
Mom, what are you talking about?

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.860
I've done too many bad things

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.660
in my life.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.820
I'm going to face the consequences.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.220
But Wenhan, don't be afraid.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.860
Though Qian Guanshu helped me
secure bail pending trial,

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:10.980
now, for you,

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.540
I will take all the blame

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.460
in court.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.020
Hope I can protect you.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.620
Why should you take the blame?

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.860
Qian Guanshu is to blame!

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.780
He's the one

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.940
who sent me to the orphanage
when I was little.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.700
You secretly visited me.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.020
You told me

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.780
that one day

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.900
you'd bring me home,

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.300
and the three of us
would be together happily.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.620
And now?

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.660
My whole life, I've been walking
the path you laid out for me.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.420
But did either of you ever
consider how I felt?

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.540
Yes, Wenhan.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.260
You're right.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.220
As parents,

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.620
we were selfish.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.100
That's exactly why

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.580
I won't let you live
that kind of life anymore.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.820
But I just can't accept it!

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.100

Let it go.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.620
Those things
were never meant to be ours.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.940
Let's just let it go.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:29.900

What kind of deal
could you possibly have with me?

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.860
What makes you qualified?

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.020

of your shady dealings.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.060
Come to my office then.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.220

on the phone.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.100
Are you really confused,

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.420
or are you playing dumb with me?

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:22.940
I'll be blunt.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.300
I have evidence

of your past crimes with Zhenhua Group.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:30.260
I'm guessing

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.340
you don't want the police

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:33.980
to get this evidence, right?

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.620
You're threatening me?

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.180
Take a good look at yourself.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.660
You're a wanted criminal.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.420
Will the police
believe anything you say?

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.700
What if I tell you

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.140
I'm the son of Qian Guanshu
and Nie Wenzhi?

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.460
Does that change your mind
even a little?

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.060
You're Guanshu

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.780
and Nie Wenzhi's son?

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.620
Qian Guanshu worked for you for years.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.580
He knows plenty

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.580
about your shady dealings.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.620
He privately collected a lot of evidence

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.100
and gave it to me for safekeeping.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.540
It's kind of like his insurance policy.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.540
If that's the insurance policy

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.860
your father left you,

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.060
why would you trade it to me?

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.460
Because Qian Guanshu
doesn't deserve to be my father.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.100
He never cared about me or my mother.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.820
If that's how he treats
his own wife and son,

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.980
do you really think he's loyal

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.020
to you?

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.020

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.300

There isn't a single word of truth
from your mouth!

But he's desperate.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:17.500
and he died.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.620
So Ye Taiting
took over the entire group.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:21.580
Alright.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:24.260
I know about the car accident.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:25.780
You can go now.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.660
And, we're still looking into the matter

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.020
concerning your mother.
There are no leads yet.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:39.820
Mr. Ye.

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:40.940
Ms. Song is here.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:42.460
Zhizhi, you're here.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.420
This is the proposal
for the Drizzt project

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.540
from Zhifu Jewelry that I took

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:50.740
from Ji Baijian's place.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:52.780
Excellent.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:56.820
Mr. Ye,

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:58.740
this is a deal.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.460
What about what you promised me?

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:02.900
Zhizhi,

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.300
don't you trust me?

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.700
I had it ready for you.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:10.860
Look at you.

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:13.100
Alright.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.180
The list

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.060
of designers and suppliers you asked for

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.300
is all here.

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:28.100
Guanshu,

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:29.780
with this proposal,

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:33.220
our chances of winning have increased.

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:35.340
Zhizhi,

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:36.420
perfect timing.

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.820
I just received
some new high-mountain tea.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:39.940
Join me for a cup over there.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:40.420
That won't be necessary.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:42.500
Thanks for the cooperation.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.380
I have other things to attend to.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.500
Guanshu, see Zhizhi out.

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:46.180
Got it.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:46.620
I know the way.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:52.260
That girl certainly has character.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:01.860
Ziming?

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:04.980
Why are you...?

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:08.660
I saw you were working late again.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:09.780
Worried you hadn't eaten,

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.100
so I brought you some late-night snacks.

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:13.500
Thank you.

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:15.820
We've both been so busy lately.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:17.540
Haven't had time to properly talk.

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:19.380
Yes.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.540
The company's team got poached.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.220
I'm recruiting new designers now.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.780
This is the state
the company's operations are in.

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:28.820
I'm not sure what to do next.

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.620
And I don't even know if these designers

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.300
will want to come here.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:38.300
What are your thoughts
on Ji Baijian then?

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:40.580
On Ji Baijian?

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:43.460
I don't really have any.

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.620
I'm not in the mood
to think about that right now.

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.340
I'm just focused on work.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:50.140
Zhizhi.

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.260
I saw

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.020
you went back to his place.

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:01.660
Yes.

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.020
Because there are still

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.740
some things unresolved between us.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:11.340
Look what I brought you.

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:20.380
What a feast.

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:22.500
By the way,

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.380
where did you get that photo

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:25.820
you asked me to look into?

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.460
Did... Did you find something?

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:30.900
Not yet.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.380
It's just that knowing the source

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:35.060
makes it easier to investigate.

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:37.620
But

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.060
that photo belongs to a friend of mine.

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.140
He probably isn't clear
about its source.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:47.460
Is it

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:49.860
related to Ji Baijian?

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.340
Ziming,

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.060
I don't want to lie to you.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.060
It is indeed Ji Baijian's.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.500
And what's between him and me...

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.140
It's very complicated.

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:06.260
It's not something
that can be resolved quickly.

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:08.860
And I have my own reasons.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:11.220
I understand.

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:13.100
I'll leave then.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:15.380
Make sure you eat something.

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.820
[Wei Ziming]
Mr. Ye, I'll go to the reception

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:45.380
tomorrow evening with you.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.220
You're off work early today.

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:18.700
What brings you here?

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.060
Where's Song Zhizhi?

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:25.740
She's not back yet.

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.060
She's met with Ye Taiting alone

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.340
a few times recently.

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:35.340
I bet she's got an agenda

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:37.220
coming back to you now.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.740
I know about her meetings
with Ye Taiting.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:42.940
I've been busy

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.340
and haven't had a chance to tell you.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:46.660
The incident with the rough gemstones

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.060
really had nothing to do with Song Shan.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.100
I found the photos of the goods pickup
and warehousing.

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:54.980
The person who picked them up
was Qian Guanshu.

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:57.220
So Ye Taiting must be behind it.

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:10.940
Ye Taiting?

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.700
That unrepentant old scum!

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:18.740
I suspected him too,

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.660
but I never got the evidence.

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:22.780
Now it's confirmed.

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.620
He ruined our family

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:29.940
and made me lose
the person I loved most.

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:32.620
I will make him pay!

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.780
It seems your judgment back then
was right.

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:43.460
What's your next move?

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:46.300
Ye Taiying's position
is now on shaky ground.

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:49.220
The reason I'm pouring all my energy

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:50.140
into the new company

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:52.940
is to use it to defeat Starlight Group.

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:55.460
I've heard some rumors

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:57.260
that if Ye Taiting fails to secure

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:58.740
the Drizzt project this time,

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:00.900
the board will likely remove him.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:03.540
Indeed.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.060
If things go smoothly for us,

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:07.980
it will be a huge blow

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:10.100
to Ye Taiting.

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:13.900
But there's quite a bit of criticism
aimed at me

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:15.900
within our group right now.

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.620
I'm hoping you can speak up for me

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:19.980
at the upcoming board meeting.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:23.860
At first,

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.700
I thought you were supporting
Zhifu Jewelry

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.100
just for Song Zhizhi.

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.900
Now I see I was wrong about you.

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:33.260
You've actually got some brains.

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.420
When did you learn to cook?

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:48.820
Smells pretty good.

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:16.540
Hello?

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:17.980
Hello?

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:19.860
You'll be off work soon, right?

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:22.300
Ji Baijian,

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:25.460
I won't go to your place anymore.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:30.060
I've already given the fake proposal
you gave me

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:31.100
to Ye Taiting.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:33.900
Our little act

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.180
is over.

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:38.540
I hope you will

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:40.460
transfer the shares
of Starlight Jewelry to me soon.

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:42.500
Then we'll be even.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:44.940
He believed that proposal?

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.900
At least he doesn't seem
to have caught on yet.

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.140
Otherwise,
he wouldn't have sent me the list.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:52.860
Well,

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.500
is everything going smoothly for you?

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:57.540
Of course it is.

00:33:58.900 --> 00:33:59.340
Mr. Ji,

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.420
you only poached a few of my designers.

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:04.500
I'll find better ones.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:06.740
Fine.

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.500
If there's nothing else, I'm hanging up.

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:10.580
Zhizhi.

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:17.660
