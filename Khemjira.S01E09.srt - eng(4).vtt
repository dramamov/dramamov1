00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.680
Maybe it's because of her

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.520
that our paths crossed again.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.360
Master was right.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.200
He knows Ramphueng.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.920
He'll catch the train early tomorrow
to come to us.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.080
Jet,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.520
can you try calling Khem?

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.760
Something feels off.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.200
Here, I made Master some dessert.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.680
You won't make it out alive this time.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.280
Now, have a bite

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.280
and see if it's as good as before.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.800
Sure, it is.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.880
You've been making this for me
since I was little.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.440
What's wrong, dear?

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.400
You can talk to me.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.960
I've been helping Grandpa
fight off spirits over and over,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.600
yet I still mess up.

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:20.480
I'm really not good, Grandma.

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.079
I can't compare to him at all.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.280
You don't need to match him, dear.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.840
No one's born a master, Paran.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.680
I'm not a kid anymore.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.040
Well,

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.920
once you become a shaman,

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.200
I won't be able to hug you.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.920
Stop that.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.320
You're making me cry.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.560
Just cry if you want to.

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.579
With me, you can be weak.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.480
No need to stay strong.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.960
My mom never got to see me
become a shaman.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.680
But I want to make you proud, Grandma.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.800
I'm already very proud of you, dear.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.920
You look troubled,

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.800
like you've lost your vital force.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.500
Let me summon it back for you.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:25.280
♫May your vital force come to me♫

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.320
♫In my arms, where you should be,♫

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.360
♫Come to the one who loves you tenderly♫

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.560
♫May your vital force come to me♫

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.920
♫Wherever pain hurts you badly,♫

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.040
♫Let it be gone completely♫

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.800
♫May your vital force come to me,♫

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.120
♫The one who loves you endlessly♫

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:12.840
♫And won't let you cry in misery♫

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:22.680
♫May your vital force come to me♫

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:30.080
♫Now it's back where it should be,♫

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:40.080
♫May it find its way
back into your body♫

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.400
- Master!
- Master!

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.040
Master!

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.040
What's going on?

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.520
- What's happening?
- Master!

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.920
Go save Khem.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.640
- But you...
- Save him!

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.200
- Yes, Master.
- Yes, Master.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.760
He's not picking up.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.800
Do you sense something?

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.320
I'm not sure,

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.600
but I feel like...

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.320
it's all dark around Khem.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.280
Can you give him another call?

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.520
Are you Jet?

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.280
Monk Kasem?

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.320
I took a car instead

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.960
as something bad is about to happen.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.400
We need to go there now.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.080
Your final moment has come.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.520
What did you do to Grandma Si?

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.840
You'd best worry about yourself.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.400
I shall reveal to you the ignominy

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.960
your family and you
have inflicted on me.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.880
Little Mistress...

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.640
Little Mistress,

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.360
please stay still.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.120
Come now, Little Mistress.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.360
Who?

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.520
Who are you?

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.320
Come on, Little Mistress.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.000
I suppose I need to get your mother.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.900
What's taking you forever, dear?

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.980
- Wait...
- Why not let Iam or Jik help you dress?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.030
Mom?

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.370
I do not like wearing
the sabai and necklace, Mother.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.410
They're uncomfortable.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.120
They are not meant for comfort.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.480
Your father wishes to see you,

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.200
so you must be properly dressed.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:11.760
Come,

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.320
I shall affix the flower crown for you.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.720
Come here, Krongkwan.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.520
It is already uncomfortable.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.960
Do I need to wear that, too?

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.880
Just a few moments of patience,

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.400
and Madam will surely be fond of you.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.440
Now that she is expecting,

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.120
she will likely be less irritable,
won't she?

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.160
Hush,

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.000
do not mention her like that again.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.320
I never taught you
to speak ill of others.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.640
I would not say such things
before others,

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.200
but she is really irritable, Mother.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.120
Ow!

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.960
This little one...

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.320
Stay still for once.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.000
[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya, 1767]

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.800
So,

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.480
this time, is it a boy or a girl?

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.440
The night before,

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:41.360
Lady Ketkeaw's natal star
aligned with the fire element,

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.240
known for its strength.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:47.760
It seems you are likely to have a son.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Is that so?

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.600
Then your wish is granted, my lord.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.280
I am most delighted.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.080
I'm having a brother, right?

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.240
I am so happy for you, Madam.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.600
If there's anything I may assist with,

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.040
do let me know at any time.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.600
Thank you, Lady Kakanang.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.120
This being my third pregnancy,

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.280
I cannot help but feel some concern.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.160
I do hope
we shall have a strong son this time.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.120
Very well.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.240
Finally,

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.680
an heir shall be born
to carry on my lineage.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.560
Indeed.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.320
But that is not it, my lord.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.360
By the chart,

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.880
it seems that you shall be blessed
with two sons, my lord.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.480
What do you mean?

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.240
Are we perhaps

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.560
having twins?

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.160
My lord!

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.320
My lord,

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.800
there is urgent news.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.000
It is most delightful.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.480
What is it now?

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.120
Could there be anything
more delightful than this?

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.280
Last night, Mistress Ramphueng
suffered severe vomiting.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.560
At dawn, I summoned the physician,

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.100
and it appears that

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.560
she may be expecting a child.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.800
Heaven be praised.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.280
Is this what you meant?

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.840
Yes, my lord.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.600
When I spoke of two sons,

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.840
I meant one from Lady Ketkeaw

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.600
and another from Mistress Ramphueng.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.840
I see.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.840
Where is she now?

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.480
Take me to her.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.840
This way, my lord.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
That's wonderful.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.520
I'm having two brothers at once, Mother.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.240
Could you not leave early, my lord?

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.400
I wish you could see our son.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.920
This duty is a direct command

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.800
from the Somdet Chao Phraya.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.600
I cannot contravene it
for personal matters.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.600
We're ready, my lord.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.800
It seems Ramphueng is suffering badly
from morning sickness

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.960
as it's her first pregnancy
at twenty-one.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.160
I suppose she won't make it in time.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.400
Please forgive her, my lord.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.840
I understand.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.600
Please forgive me.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.160
I thought something had happened to you,

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.400
and thus you did not come to see me off.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.280
I apologize for being late, my lord.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.160
I made you a garland with all my heart.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.440
How wonderful.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.680
I only hope
you succeed in your duty promptly

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.760
and return in time
to see both of your sons.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.640
How thoughtful of you.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.000
I'm sure this little garland

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:47.040
can hasten his success in his duty.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.000
Not at all, ma'am.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:53.040
I only wish to help him
in any way I can.

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:55.520
My only skills lie in handiwork,

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.240
and there's still so much
I must learn from you, ma'am.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.680
How fortunate I am

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.760
to have good wives,

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.840
who love and support one another.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.960
Take care of yourselves,

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.760
both of you,

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.800
for you are carrying my cherished sons.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.000
And you?

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.760
Do you not want another child?

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.160
And you,

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.080
would you like another sibling?

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.960
I am not strong enough
to bear another child,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.520
yet I swear
I shall care for both of the sons

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.360
as if they were my own

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.880
in gratitude
to Madam and Ramphueng

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.400
for carrying your heirs for me.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.160
Thank you, all three of you.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.840
With you at the house,

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.080
my mind is at ease.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.800
I'm leaving now.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.040
- Alright, my lord.
- Alright.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:37.880
What is it?

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.920
Is it severe?

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.880
It's just a fever,

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.160
which is common in pregnancy.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:46.600
Last time

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.080
you said the same thing

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.880
before I lost my child.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.000
Go fetch the physician.

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:56.960
Have her checked just to be sure.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.840
I've already been checked.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.280
Our son is safe, my lord.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.600
This is my third pregnancy.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.480
There is no cause for concern.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.000
I thank you deeply

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.520
for carrying my hopes within you,

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.840
yet you are no longer young.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.840
Still, you are my first wife,

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.920
who has never once
neglected your duties.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.280
Take good care of yourself.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.440
This is to be your last pregnancy.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.290
Do your duties as best you can.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:34.960
Go and rest now.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.180
It'll be best for our son.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.080
Why not rest here tonight, my lord?

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.880
There is still much work
I must attend to.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.320
You should just take a rest.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.120
Is it work,

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.040
or that Ramphueng bitch?

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.240
[Ubon Ratchathani, 2025]

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.640
Master!

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.560
Master!

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.680
Master, what happened?

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.400
Master...

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.640
- Master...
- Master!

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:45.800
Master!

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.160
- Everyone,
- Master...

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.320
move aside.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:08.280
(Casting a spell)

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.760
Master...

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:14.320
Master!

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.960
Master...

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:17.860
- Master!
- Master.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:19.320
What happened?

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.480
Where is Khem, Master?

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.440
Master...

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.520
Khem...

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.360
- Khem!
- Khem!

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.200
I heard a little thump.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.440
Is the baby alright?

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.440
He's just moving,

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.920
which means he is very strong

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.200
and excited to meet his sister.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.480
Come out soon, little one.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:32.200
Why don't you play
with Jik and Iam for a bit

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.480
while I speak with Auntie Ramphueng?

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:36.640
Yes, Mother.

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.720
I really wish my son...

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.120
were as bright and clever
as your daughter.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.720
If Krongkwan were a boy,

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.680
His Lordship
would've cherished him dearly.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.760
It is not her good fortune
to be born a woman.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.440
Rather,

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.080
it is mine.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.560
Lady Kakanang,

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.120
I understand your concern,

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.920
yet I have already assured Madam

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.760
that my son shall live
as a servant as I do,

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.980
and shall never seek
to rival her son in lineage.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.320
That may be your intention,

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.960
but he already carries the bloodline
of His Lordship.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.680
I only wish...

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.040
to be with the man I love.

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:35.820
Ramphueng,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.880
forgive my intrusion.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:40.560
You are still so young.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.080
His Lordship's care and support

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.440
are what you see as love.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.560
What else could it be?

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.020
That's more than enough
for a servant like me.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.680
I wish to repay him

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.840
by bearing a son,

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.520
and it is proper.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.360
It is indeed proper.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.800
I only wish to warn you.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.960
Consider carefully

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.400
what you love more,

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.240
His Lordship

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.740
or your own life.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.840
You do know

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.760
there is someone
who can't stand seeing your son grow.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.480
Think carefully, Ramphueng.

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.640
You're only twenty-one.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.680
You have many more years to live.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.080
Lady Kakanang,

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.120
Madam Ketkeaw is about to give birth.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.680
Take a deep breath, ma'am.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.080
- One more time, ma'am.
- One more try, ma'am.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.120
- Please push.
- Madam...

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.320
Please push, ma'am.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:05.640
The baby's here!

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.880
Young Master!

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.520
He's here, ma'am.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.800
Young Master is here.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.440
Midwife,

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.000
let me see my son.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.360
What are you doing?

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.840
What happened?

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.160
Why does Young Master make no sound?

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.600
Why is that?

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:35.400
He is not breathing, ma'am.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.080
What did you say?

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.600
Young Master is not breathing, ma'am.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.000
What do you mean?

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.360
It is possible, ma'am.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.400
No!

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.140
That's not true.

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.400
- Ma'am...
- My son is breathing!

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.120
- Ma'am, stay still.
- He is alive!

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.600
You can't move yet, ma'am.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.160
- Please, ma'am.
- No...

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.200
- Let me see him...
- Please don't get up yet, ma'am.

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.840
Give me my son!

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.600
Why?

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:35.320
Why is fate so cruel?

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.080
- Ma'am...
- Stay strong, ma'am.

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.080
Sweetheart, I'm sorry.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.000
I am sorry.

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.560
- Why?
- Ma'am, please stop.

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.140
Please don't do that.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.520
Please, ma'am.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.560
Calm down, ma'am.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.040
Why?

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.920
Why must it be me?

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.840
Why me?

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.320
Please stop that, ma'am.

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:05.440
Please don't do that.

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:07.840
Why?

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.120
Are you sure, Ramphueng?

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.440
What has changed your mind?

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.160
I have pondered

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.400
the question you asked me,

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.200
and my answer is clear now.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.600
It is not that I love His Lordship,

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.640
nor that I love myself.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.720
But I love this child deeply

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.280
from the very first moment I saw him.

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.320
I love him with all my heart.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.920
Then,

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:08.480
I'll have someone await your son

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:09.920
at the grove behind the house,

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.360
and let it be known

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:17.640
that your son is dead,
just as Madam's was.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.000
My son,

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.480
go live your life,

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.760
grow strong,

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.400
and be free.

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.520
I'm sorry

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.640
that my fate

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.800
has granted you so little.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:05.960
Be careful, please.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.200
Where are you rushing off to?

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:11.840
Madam...

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.000
I heard that Ramphueng lost her child.

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.880
Aren't you supposed to be with her?

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.240
I'm on my way
to fetch the medicine, ma'am.

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.040
Who's that behind you?

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.880
She's my relative.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.080
I'll have her work in the kitchen.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.360
You think I'm stupid?

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.560
Get her.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.600
Yes, ma'am.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.720
- Stop.
- Move, Sai.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.850
- No.
- I said move!

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:40.520
No.

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.300
- You should move.
- I told you to go away!

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:43.060
Sai!

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:44.220
Ramphueng?

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.400
Come!

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.040
Your son's alive.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.840
You lied to me

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:51.480
and deceived me, didn't you?

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.560
You're trying to impress His Lordship
when he's back, aren't you?

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.380
No, ma'am.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:56.900
Give me your son now.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:58.200
Give me that boy.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.160
Give me the boy!

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:00.200
Give me! I said...

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.640
Go away from me.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.120
No one can take my son from me.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.360
I am the lady of this house.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.120
Whatever I command must be done.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.520
Take the boy.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:12.320
Yes, ma'am.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.050
- Get the boy.
- Don't take him.

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:24.040
Don't take him away.

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:26.040
My son...

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:27.670
Ma'am...

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.400
Ma'am.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:30.200
Please don't.

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.000
Ma'am, please.

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:31.760
Ma'am...

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.600
Please don't hurt Young Master, ma'am.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.400
What did you call him?

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.480
Young Master, ma'am.

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:46.240
Ma'am...

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:47.800
Ma'am!

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.680
Ma'am,

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.240
please don't do that.

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:52.260
Ma'am...

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.520
What are you trying to do, ma'am?

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.040
Ma'am...

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.440
Ma'am!

00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.480
Let go of me!

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.680
He is merely a servant's son.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:17.040
Only my son
can be the Young Master of this house.

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:21.580
Sai...

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:22.960
Sai...

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.480
Sai!

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.680
Why has Ramphueng not arrived?

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.240
Could it be that
she has changed her mind?

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:24.680
There she is.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.120
What? What happened, Jik?

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.280
Little Mistress...

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.600
She followed you here,

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.720
and she's now missing, my lady.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.240
What did you say?

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.160
Why should fortune smile upon you?

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.800
I have faithfully fulfilled my duties
as a wife for years,

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:57.280
yet you, a mere servant,

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.760
dare to take everything from me.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.200
And worse than that,

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:08.840
you're trying to have your son
raised above mine.

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:10.280
That's not true, ma'am.

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:11.679
It is not.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.560
I stand by my word

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:19.320
that my son shall be a servant

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.239
and never presume to rival yours.

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.280
You lying bitch!

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.040
Ever since the beginning,

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.679
your audacity has known no bounds.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.880
Ma'am,

00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:33.600
you just lost your son.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.840
I'm sure you understand the pain, ma'am.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.159
Please return my baby to me.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.719
I'm begging you, ma'am.

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:46.080
I, too, wish
you could understand my pain.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.199
Since my son was not granted life,

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.880
then neither shall yours.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:54.800
Ma'am...

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.920
Ma'am, please.

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.440
Ma'am!

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.480
Ma'am!

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.600
Ma'am...

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:02.520
Ma'am!

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.640
My lady?

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:27.280
My lady...

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.580
Lady Kakanang...

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.560
Lady Kakanang!

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.420
Lock her up

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:38.440
and silence every servant of this house.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.360
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:45.960
Go!

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.400
Go now.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.860
- I'm not going.
- Go!

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.100
No, I'm taking my son back!

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:52.640
Just go.

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:55.240
Come on.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:19.620
Come.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.680
Lady Ketkeaw
has informed me of the matter,

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.640
yet I shall not heed one side alone.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.360
Tell me, Ramphueng.

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:39.980
Did you really hurl her son
into the river?

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.920
Did you tell him that, Ketkeaw?

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:55.360
Do not dare address her
without her proper title!

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.560
What actually happened?

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:58.840
Answer me!

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.280
My lord, you know very well

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:04.860
the kind of person I am.

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.960
How could I be capable
of such a cruel act?

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.480
Had it been in former days,

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.960
I would have believed that.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.120
Yet I was told that

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.520
after she lost her son,

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.240
she lost her mind as well,

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.520
turning to opium.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.040
And when I conceived

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.520
and bore my son,

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.480
she came to steal him away to kill.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:27.400
Liar.

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:30.680
How shamelessly
you spin your lies, Ketkeaw!

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:31.880
Ramphueng,

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:34.600
mind the words you speak.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.820
You told me

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:42.960
you would not heed one side alone,

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.040
didn't you, my lord?

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:53.040
Madam, driven by envy

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:57.600
after her own son died
immediately after birth,

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.600
she attacked me

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:04.800
and took my son...

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.320
to kill, my lord.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.400
So it was your son?

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:17.240
Yes, my lord.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:18.560
That's not true.

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.960
Our son was born in perfect health,

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.000
leaving me weak.

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:25.840
Yet it was Ramphueng

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.520
who seized the opportunity
to abduct him.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:33.040
Even Lady Kakanang and Krongkwan
came to visit us.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.320
The servants,
thinking she merely wished to see me,

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.720
let her in,

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:39.560
not knowing that

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.680
she intended to kill our son.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.080
That's not true.

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.240
Is this true,

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:53.100
my lady?

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.800
Do you remember your two elder sisters?

00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:59.340
Those who are
Lady Radamanee's daughters.

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.440
They were sent to their grandparents
in Suphan Buri

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:07.080
after their mother fell ill
and passed away.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.440
Do you remember them?

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.160
Yes, Mother.

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:14.280
In truth, her death

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:16.800
was caused by Madam.

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.800
As long as you stay here,

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:24.080
you must never give her
any cause for displeasure.

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.680
Yes, my lord.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.800
My daughter and I...

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.600
went to see Madam that night.

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:38.640
That's not true.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.550
It's not true, my lord.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:45.760
That night, they were there with us.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.600
Both of you

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.760
witnessed everything she did,

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:56.640
yet why are you lying?

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.440
Little Mistress...

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:08.880
Little Mistress Krongkwan,

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.880
you saw it, too, didn't you?

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:12.800
Ramphueng...

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.160
You saw it, didn't you?

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.920
Please help me, Little Mistress.

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.480
Please, Little Mistress. Please help me.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.040
Krongkwan,

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:24.120
come here.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.480
Tell me.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.320
What did you see last night?

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:51.320
Do you understand?

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.400
But if I lie,

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:58.680
will Auntie Ramphueng die?

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.320
But if you tell the truth,

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.240
what will become of Jik and Iam?

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.680
Little Mistress...

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.360
We may be safe,

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.200
protected by our titles,

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:16.760
but our servants

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:18.680
shall surely lose their heads.

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:30.400
I saw Auntie Ramphueng...

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.800
hurl the boy into the river.

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:35.920
No.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:37.840
That's not true.

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:39.760
No, it's not true.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:41.840
No...

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:43.440
Madam!

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:48.300
The person who delivered opium
to Mistress Ramphueng has been captured.

00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:53.080
That's not me.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:54.560
Not at all.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:56.080
It has nothing to do with me.

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.720
These wretches are accusing me.

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.040
They're lying, my lord.

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.160
They're framing me.

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.320
It's not true, my lord.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.720
- Don't fall for them.
- Take this wretch away

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.680
and have her flogged to death!

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.240
Don't believe them. Let me go.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.640
- Go.
- Let go of me!

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:11.400
Go away.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.720
All of you are wretches.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.040
You all are!

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.680
Every last one of you.

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.080
I shall remember all of you,

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.560
every single one,

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.400
and lay a curse upon you all...

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.120
Flog her!

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:33.400
- Now!
- May you all die a violent death.

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.280
Just you wait.

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:37.200
You are all cursed to die!

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:38.880
You filthy bitch!

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.520
You damned wretch!

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:03.800
Look.

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:05.920
See it.

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:08.360
See what I had to go through.

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.800
I place my curse upon you all.

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:24.720
May your line

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.240
be struck with misfortune,

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.640
with no sons to carry your name.

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.280
If you die,

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.640
may you be reborn,

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.680
and I shall claim my vengeance.

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.240
Should you be reborn as a woman,

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.080
may you...

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.400
suffer separation from your beloved,

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.920
either by being parted

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.560
or by death,

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:03.760
as I was parted from my son.

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.160
And should you be reborn a man,

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.240
may death claim you

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.360
at twenty-one,

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.200
as it now claims me.

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.160
Mom?

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:40.800
Mom...

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.880
Where are you?

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:10.120
I've been waiting for you every day.

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:13.680
Why don't you come back?

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:22.240
Look around you.

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:27.880
They've all paid for what they did to me
in every lifetime.

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:23.400
No...

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:26.200
Wat...

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:27.920
You can't die this way.

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:32.560
You can't leave me, Wat.

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:52.120
All have faced their karma,

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.040
except you.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.600
You're the last one.

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.600
Only then

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.080
will my hatred finally fade.

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:18.510
Can you hear me, Khem?

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:19.480
Khem...

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:20.720
Khem!

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:24.560
Can you hear me?

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.120
Khem, go now.

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:51.520
Khem!

00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:52.490
Khem!

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:53.800
Khem...

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.200
What happened?

00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:58.720
Master,

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.000
what happened to you?

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:02.400
Don't worry about me.

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:04.200
Where is Grandma Si?

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:09.200
She...

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:14.680
- Khem!
- Khem...

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:15.880
- Master!
- Khem!

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:17.040
- Khem!
- Khem...

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.400
- Khem.
- Khem!

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:19.600
Calm down, Khem.

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:20.400
Khem!

00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:22.640
Khem, are you alright?

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:24.520
Khem,

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:26.240
what happened?

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:28.920
It's Ramphueng.

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:30.280
What did she do?

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:32.000
She possessed Grandma Si.

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:21.480
Grandma Si!

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:24.360
- Grandma...
- Grandma...

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:25.400
- Grandma!
- No...

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:28.440
Go get Uncle Chai.

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:29.420
Grandma Si!

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:32.720
I told you to go get him.

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.360
And call an ambulance.

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:40.760
An elder drowned.

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:42.120
Yes.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.200
Can you please hurry?

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.060
Please.

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:50.360
Please move.

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:54.880
Check her pulse, please.

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:26.560
That's enough, Khem.

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:28.240
No.

00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:29.680
It hasn't been twenty minutes.

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:31.480
She might make it.

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:34.080
Trust me.

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:35.320
Grandma...

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:36.200
That's enough.

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.440
Grandma...

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:40.080
No.

00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:41.920
No.

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.320
It can't end like this.

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:45.480
Wake up, Grandma.

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:46.840
I told you to stop.

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.400
Grandma, please.

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:52.440
I said that's enough.

[Si Boonheung, 84 years old,

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:22.600
May 5, 1941 - May 25, 2025]

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.240
Si,

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.360
may you find peace

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.160
and reach a better realm.

00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:31.040
Hello.

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:33.760
Come inside.

00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:37.560
No one's blaming you.

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:39.360
Come on.

00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:43.080
It's okay.

00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:45.720
I...

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.200
I can't.

00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:08.960
Si left this letter for me.

00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.520
It seems she had a heart condition

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:14.200
and likely passed away the day before.

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:15.520
[Please take care
of Master Paran and Khem]

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:17.480
And Ramphueng

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:21.920
must have taken over her body.

00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:25.080
I thought I should tell you

00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:28.200
that her passing

00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:31.560
had nothing to do with you.

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:36.160
The villagers
are also aware of this truth,

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:38.960
so you may rest your mind.

00:55:58.640 --> 00:55:59.640
May I ask

00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:02.680
where you intend to stay?

00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:05.920
I have informed
my fellow monks and the abbot

00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:08.800
that I'll be residing here temporarily.

00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:10.480
Khem,

00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:12.800
if you must grieve,

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:15.160
then let it all out.

00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:18.480
Once Si's funeral is over,

00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:21.000
we...

00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:24.400
must deal with Ramphueng.

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:39.720
No, Ake.

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:41.600
Don't do this.

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:46.440
I can't live without Thong.

00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:49.360
Jet, please let me go.

00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:52.280
Thong?

00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:55.600
What happened to him?

00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:59.440
It seems Ramphueng...

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:06.560
Khem!

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:07.880
Master,

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:12.640
can you please bring Thong back?

00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:50.520
I'm sorry.

00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:53.560
It's not your fault, Khem.

00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:57.400
Thong did as he wished

00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:00.600
and fulfilled his duty

00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:02.200
until his very last day.

00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:14.880
I'm ready.

00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.800
Please send me to him, Master.

00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:20.280
Please, Ake.

00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:22.680
Can you not go?

00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:26.080
I've made up my mind.

00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:29.880
Please let me be with him.

00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:46.220
Thank you so much for everything.

00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:58.800
Goodbye, Khem, Jet.

00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:02.880
Please tell Charn I said goodbye.

00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:10.240
Ake...

00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:13.000
I'm really sorry.

00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:19.360
Ake...

00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:22.720
I'm sorry.

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.400
You know,

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:27.920
when I was little,

01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:30.660
every time I sneaked out,

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.120
Grandma Si always helped me
get away with it.

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.320
And Thong and Ake...

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.840
They knew I had no friends,

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:45.900
so they became ones.

01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:50.260
I understand

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.800
you're grieving, Jet,

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:55.960
but everyone has found peace.

01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:59.800
If they looked from up above

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.080
and saw you not feeling cheerful,

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.040
they would worry about you.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:08.840
No matter what happens,

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:12.200
you'll still have me by your side.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.440
As a friend.

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:38.040
We have no idea what lies ahead.

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:43.240
I guess you'd want to take a break
from us for now, right?

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.640
Thank you

01:03:58.720 --> 01:03:59.920
for understanding me.

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.960
Once things with Khem are settled,

01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:07.940
we can continue where we left off.

01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:14.400
When that time comes,

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.200
let's make everything clear between us.

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:27.360
For now,

01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:30.040
let's just be best friends.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:53.320
Uncle Chai...

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:56.000
Oh, Khem?

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.040
What is it?

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:00.860
I'd like to...

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:02.780
ask for your help.

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:29.120
Master?

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.520
Am I your master again now?

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.040
Uh...

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.680
I'm sorry.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.280
I was just...

01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:56.120
Please don't go, Khem.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.600
Be with me.

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.760
But Grandma Si,

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:09.560
Thong,

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.210
and even Ake...

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:15.360
Everyone you loved

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.240
is gone because of me.

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:26.720
Grandma Si's time had just come.

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.520
And Thong and Ake...

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.720
were meant to be reborn long ago.

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:41.680
I was making them stay.

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:45.600
No,

01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:48.580
that's not true.

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:51.040
It's me.

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.520
It's my fault.

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.220
You know very well, Khem,

01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:00.310
that it's not like that.

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.280
But...

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.920
I don't think I can face anyone anymore.

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.560
I have no one left, Khem.

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.520
Please stay with me.

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:39.800
Peem...

01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:43.260
I'm sorry.

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:22.800
Peem!

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:31.399
I'm okay.

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:38.479
Peem!

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:57.000
Ramphueng's power is still affecting me,

01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.560
but it should fade in a day or two.

01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:03.740
Don't worry.

01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:09.859
She's in so much pain as well.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:17.960
She'll probably lie low for a while

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:22.920
and won't show up anytime soon.

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:28.100
I'm most worried about you.

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:35.000
Then don't leave me, Khem.

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:45.120
Khem...

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:20.640
Peem,

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:24.820
I truly thank you for everything.

01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:29.440
Every moment I've spent with you

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:33.120
has made my life worth living.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.040
You let me experience a kind of love

01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:38.720
I never thought I'd have.

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.440
[Jet]

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:50.080
I've been surrounded
by people who love me,

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:53.560
and it makes me feel so lucky
to have been born.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.120
Is he picking up, Jet?

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:02.240
Let's borrow someone's car.

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:03.000
Okay.

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:05.480
Even if I don't make it past tomorrow,

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:07.120
I won't regret a thing.

01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:09.930
Uh... Bangkok, please.

01:13:09.970 --> 01:13:12.260
The next train comes at 2:50 P.M.

01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:13.340
Thank you.

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.960
I'm not giving up.

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:23.840
But from now on,

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.640
I'll find my own way,

01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:32.660
so no one else gets hurt because of me.

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:44.600
May every day ahead of you

01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:47.580
be full of smiles, Peem.

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:50.800
Khem!

01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:52.880
I'm sorry, Jet,

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.520
but I can't bear losing anyone again.

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:55.680
We're coming with you, then.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:58.760
Khem's birthday is in seven days.

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.000
If he makes it until then,

01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:01.160
the curse will be lifted.

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.400
Are you sure you can handle this

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:04.800
without your master?

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:06.960
He's already lost so much for me.

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:08.760
- Khemjira must survive!
- Khemjira must survive!

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:12.240
(Chanting)

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Khem,

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:16.360
don't give up yet.

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:36.390
♫One day you'll taste
the pain I've known,♫

01:15:36.690 --> 01:15:43.010
♫Fall for the lies of a heart of stone♫

01:15:43.050 --> 01:15:50.250
♫Your life will be shattered
by the one by your side,♫

01:15:50.480 --> 01:16:02.050
♫Only then will you see through my eyes♫
