00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.440
(This drama is based on
the 2018 cryptocurrency market.)

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.570
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.940
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.510
Wait, for real?

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.610
It's for real.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.350
We really just made 3,000 bucks
sitting here?

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.720
- We did!
- No way!

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.190
- That's hot.
- Pull yourself together.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.230
Let's take Thursday and Friday off.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.730
With the weekend,
that's four days to have fun.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.100
What are you talking about?

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.400
We have to check if what we earned
is actual money or just crap.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.200
Let's take a trip and bring Ji Song.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.270
A trip?

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.070
We made some cash,
so I'll flex a little.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.970
- It's all on me.
- Then I'll get the food.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.850
Let's really flex this time
and make sure Ji Song comes with us.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.350
- To the moon!
- To the moon!

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.620
Then I hereby name this trip...

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.790
A Trip with the Average Girls...

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.260
- to Namhae!
- to Namhae!

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.260
Let's try a bite.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.110
For our trip's itinerary,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.480
I've planned out
the whole thing perfectly.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.950
What is it?

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.250
The Golden Namhae Train.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.150
- What?
- What?

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.290
It goes from Busan Station
to Namhae.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.860
On a clear day, across the ocean,

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.560
you can see way out
to tiny little islands.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.460
And best of all,
we can pick oysters.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.030
We get two kilograms per person.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.000
We'll make three dollars each.
How awesome is that?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.600
- Not awesome at all.
- And for dinner...

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.040
Prepare to be amazed.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.780
There's a dinner show
on the schedule.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.780
A what? A dinner show?

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.850
What is happening right now?

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.220
What, you don't like it?

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.890
Forget it. Kim Ji Song!

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.120
You do it.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.490
I've decided to make you
our new tour guide.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.560
Okay! Then, starting right now,

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.230
I'll look up the hottest clubs
in the Busan area.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.730
- Clubs?
- But I can't dance.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.670
Shouldn't you be worried about
getting past the bouncer first?

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.070
You want me to snap your neck?

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.140
Come on, you can just learn
how to dance.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.340
Don't worry, just follow my lead.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.280
Think of it as letting your body
go with the rhythm.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.450
Do a little body roll,

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.120
sway with it,
and then put your hands up!

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.260
- Hands up.
- Hands up, yes, hands up...

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.790
Come on, why are you all so timid?

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.500
Dancing is all about attitude!

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.600
Put your hands up!

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.530
- Put your hands up!
- Hands up!

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.770
- Put your hands up!
- Hands up!

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.440
Put your hands up!

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.770
Put your hands up!

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.440
Sorry, about this.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.310
Come on, do the body roll,
and then put your hands up.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.550
Hands up!

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.600
Okay. And do the body roll...

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.010
The doors are closing.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.880
It'd be weird...

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.420
if it were just us two eating, right?

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.820
Plus, people would've talked.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.520
So I invited Eun Sang and Ji Song.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.260
But the thing is, when it's just us,

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.090
we lose all track of time and space
and end up having fun by ourselves.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.230
So you're going on a trip?

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.200
Yes. We are.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.330
For three days and two nights.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.040
We're planning to party so hard
we might not make it back.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.770
From what I heard, you were planning
to leave it all on the dance floor.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:06.980
"Put your hands up?"

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.110
We were just messing around.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.620
Besides, there are lots of
other places to go than clubs.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.650
We have to go to the mountains,
the sea...

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.860
We even have to go to the moon.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:22.860
Sorry? You're going where?

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.500
I meant we're going hiking.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.930
They say the view from the ridgeline
is supposed to be amazing right now.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.740
So are the clubs, I hear.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.770
The doors are opening.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.510
You're pretty persistent.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.580
"Persistent?"

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.650
The doors are closing.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.020
Want to see me
get really persistent?

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.960
What are we to each other?

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.660
I think my feelings are
pretty obvious.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.200
So at this point, isn't it only fair
for you to tell me how you feel?

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.500
I really can't tell how you feel,
Jung Da Hae.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.570
Dr. Ham, you're way too good for me.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.510
So I think
we should just be friends.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.240
Fifteenth floor.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.210
Why the fifteenth floor?

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.250
I'm going to HR.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.910
To mess up
your performance review...

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.020
by reporting
your insubordination and deceit.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.250
- Oh my gosh, are you crazy?
- Canceled.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.320
How was I leading you on?

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.520
If you played with someone's feelings,
it's called deceit.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.320
And it was your boss too.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.190
Suddenly you're taking
management's side?

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.060
Is this a labor dispute
we're having?

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:35.730
Jung Da Hae.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.570
What are we going to be?

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.110
Like I said before,
we should just be friends...

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.810
Would you just think about it?

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.380
Think before you speak for once!
What are you, a parrot?

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.850
Why do you keep repeating yourself?

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.990
Look.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.330
You're too excited about your trip
to think clearly right now.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.960
So after you get back,
we can calmly...

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.800
and slowly figure things out.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.940
You could have at least
let me finish.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.970
- Fifteenth floor.
- Okay, fine!

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.940
We'll talk later.
After I get back from my trip,

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.880
we can talk about it then.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.950
Labor talks need careful handling.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.790
(Episode 6: The Art of the Flex)

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.460
- We're in Namhae!
- Namhae!

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.420
For a car that wouldn't start,
this isn't half bad.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.160
- We saved so much thanks to you.
- Hey, it's the least I could do.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.100
Look at those flowers over there.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.330
The vibes are immaculate!

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.940
It's so great, right, guys?

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.670
No way!
It went up another 150 dollars!

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:25.610
Yes! Nice!

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.640
Gosh, you guys, seriously!

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.250
Wasn't it bad enough in Seoul?
Must you talk about crypto here too?

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.550
Come on, it's just that
crypto is doing so well right now.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.050
You should stop being so stubborn
and get in on it, okay?

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.620
The sooner you get in,
the more money you'll make.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.260
I told you.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.190
Bring up crypto again,
and we're going home.

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.100
- I'm getting out.
- Okay!

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.430
All right,
we won't say another word.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.100
So, where are we off to first?

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.070
First, we should get
something to eat.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.940
Okay, if you look here,

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.940
I made a full itinerary
for our trip.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.610
What? "The Namhae Trip Itinerary?"

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.450
Oh my gosh, will you look at
how organized she is?

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.220
And she's never this organized
when it comes to work.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.420
So what's on the menu?

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:15.720
(Namhae Sea Table,
Bluefin Tuna Course, Assorted Course)

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.900
It's a hot spot, so I booked ahead.
But it is a bit pricey, right?

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.230
We could just leave now if you want.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:27.940
Let's do it!

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.100
Really?

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.940
We came all this way
to splurge for once, didn't we?

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.640
You've got to know how to spend it
to know how to earn it.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.380
Exactly. We've spent our whole lives
pinching pennies.

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.220
It's okay to flex like this
once in a while.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:42.690
So, in that spirit,

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.790
let's go
with the Bluefin Tuna Course.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.260
Let's not!

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.390
- What?
- What?

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.860
Hey, if we get that, we'll have to
live on air for the next two days.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.870
We can go big,
but let's not lose our minds.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.330
You think so?

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.070
The flounder should be good too.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:02.170
All right.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.440
Okay, let's try that again.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.310
To the Flounder Course.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.550
- Let's do it!
- Let's do it!

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.820
- Let's go.
- Let's eat!

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.590
- Team Chojang!
- Team Chojang!

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.310
Here, try this too.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.710
What? Sir, isn't this wild abalone?

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.580
But we didn't order this.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.710
It's on the house.

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.280
It's great seeing you
enjoy your meal.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.380
It's our most popular dish,
so I wanted you to try some.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.520
Really?

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:53.460
Oh my goodness.
We are so grateful. Truly grateful.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.630
Completely, absolutely, thank you.
Thank you very much!

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.030
Don't mind her.
She's our resident weirdo.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:01.630
She doesn't bite.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.330
- Thank you, sir.
- Enjoy.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.370
- I can't believe he...
- Thank you!

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.000
- Isn't this way too much?
- This is amazing.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.070
Well, hello there!

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.420
- Gosh, I got something in my teeth.
- Do you want a toothpick?

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.060
Goodness.

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:27.490
It's not every day...

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:28.990
you get the luxury
of abalone stuck in your teeth.

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.160
Why are you in such a hurry
to pick it out?

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.800
Gosh, you're so gross
that I can't hang out with you.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:34.960
So, is it good?

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.500
Yes, whatever.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.100
Let's go on ahead to the car.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.170
I want to check our crypto
before Ji Song gets back.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.210
Good idea. Let's go.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.510
Okay, let's see.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:50.810
Oh, wait. Hold on.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.920
What? What's going on?

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.520
- Did it dip a little?
- Yes, it dropped.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.660
- No way.
- But it's not a huge drop.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.220
It won't keep dropping like this,
will it?

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.960
No, don't worry.
It's probably temporary.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.290
That's so weird.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:08.400
It was trending up,
so why did it drop?

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:22.410
Seriously, just use a toothpick.
That's so gross.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.480
What are you talking about?

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:26.980
Gosh, stop smacking your lips.
You just keep doing it.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.050
- When was I smacking my lips?
- This whole time.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:31.450
Wait a minute.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.090
Who are you?
What are you doing in my car?

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.830
- I don't think this is our car!
- This must be their car!

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.770
Shut up and get out!

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.200
- We're so sorry!
- Sorry!

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.070
- What's with them? Are they crazy?
- Sorry!

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:58.650
Give me your phones.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.020
- I promise I won't look.
- Right.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.820
I really won't look again.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.990
It dipped, so I peeked for a second.
That's all.

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:07.190
Sure, you won't.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:08.420
If I left it up to you,

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:09.690
you'd still be on
that crypto train on the boat...

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.490
and even while we're hiking.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:12.560
You're driving me crazy!

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.000
I'm telling you, we won't look.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:17.300
Right. Whatever Ji Song wants,
Ji Song gets.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:18.870
So give them to me.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.170
I just want to be fully present
with you guys on this trip.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.170
That's what I really want to do.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.140
I'll hold on to them until tonight.
Now, give them to me.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:29.210
Darn it.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.950
- Wait, I got a text from Dr. Ham...
- Give it to me.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.250
Okay, fine. Here.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.100
So now what? What's up next?

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:50.530
What do you think?

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.340
Now the real fun begins.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:58.710
Alright, then. Let's have a blast.

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:02.110
- Here you go.
- Alright, let me see.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.580
- It's the ocean!
- Hello!

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.720
- Gosh, look over there!
- Yahoo!

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.750
Look at that!

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.860
Okay, everyone, look here!

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.660
Ready? One, two, three!

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.530
Let's spin!

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.000
It's so refreshing out here.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.720
- How's this?
- That's the one.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.650
Hey, guys! What do you say
we get matching ones?

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.220
- Perfect, there are three.
- Dibs on the purple one.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:47.420
Yellow? Then I guess I'll take pink.

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:54.930
No way!

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.110
This is crazy!

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.380
- Amazing.
- This is insane.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.520
Ta-da!

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.960
I always want to soothe
my back when I go in warm water.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.960
She looks like
a competitor in "Dream Team."

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.770
She's more like
"Idol Star Athletic Championships,"

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:31.970
and not the "Dream Team."

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.200
Oh, is that right?

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.340
- What's that look for?
- What?

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.480
You look like you're in one of those
emotional troop reunion videos.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.680
You have the exact face of a private
looking for his mom in the crowd.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:45.310
That old reunion show.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.280
Gosh, so annoying.
I get it, darn it.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:49.750
What? Why?

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:53.720
My mom gets cupping done a lot, too.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.420
Seeing you just reminded me of her.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:01.460
On days when I feel like I've spent
a little too much money,

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:03.000
for some reason, I always end up
thinking about my mom.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:04.370
Why?

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:05.930
You feel guilty?

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.770
Because your mom works to the bone,
and gets cupping for all her aches,

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:14.340
and you feel like you're out there,
blowing money on whatever?

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:18.480
Gosh, I don't know.
When I spend money, I think of her.

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:19.850
Just enjoy yourself.

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.090
All moms feel the same way.

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:27.760
The good things they missed out on,
all the places they couldn't go,

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.190
and all the good things
the world has to offer...

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.690
They want their daughters
to have it all.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.330
So just have an absolute blast!

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.100
Live the life your mom would want.
Don't give it a second thought.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.010
You think so?

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.910
But are you speaking as a daughter
or as a mother?

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.950
I'm just speaking as a drunk.

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:54.080
I knew it.

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:02.020
Hey, Kim Ji Song!
Let's go get another round!

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.230
What for?
Let's hang out here longer!

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.360
Hey, can I get my phone back
for just a second?

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.030
There's something important
I need to tell my mom. Please?

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.100
I haven't even been able to
check my texts from Dr. Ham.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.740
Hey, give it here! Give it to me!

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.180
Mom, it's me.

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.350
It's your darling daughter.

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.490
My phone? Oh, I didn't lose it.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:36.330
It's the whole situation I'm in.

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:38.690
Have I eaten?

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:41.030
Of course I have.

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:46.700
The food here is delicious,
the ocean is beautiful,

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.300
and most of all,
the people are so nice.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.110
They'll just take a picture
for tourists like us,

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:54.210
and they put so much care into it.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:55.580
Oh, right.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.780
This guy offered to take our picture
and make our legs look longer,

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.380
and I'm telling you,

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.720
he lay down flat on the ground
just to get the shot.

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:08.120
Oh, and the restaurants
are so generous too.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.660
They kept giving us free things.
Even abalone!

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:15.860
So you have to come with us
next time, Mom.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:22.540
You should stay at a fancy hotel,
eat a fancy meal,

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:24.270
and enjoy a million-dollar view.

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:27.810
You deserve at least one day
to rest like that. Right?

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.880
Your daughter...

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.750
will make lots of money
and treat you like a queen...

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:37.690
Mom, are you crying?

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.330
Oh, you're brushing your teeth?

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.160
You're going to bed,
so you want me to hang up?

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:52.100
Mom, but weren't you
even a little bit moved?

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.410
Why are you cursing at me?

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:58.310
Goodness.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.480
Can I have my phone back now?
Please?

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:08.780
What are you staring at?

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:11.750
It's nothing.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.920
Da Hae was boasting to her mom
that she'd treat her like a queen.

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:19.260
I know
it's just the alcohol talking,

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.230
but I still envy her confidence.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.030
You should tell Wei Lin that too.
That you'll treat him like a king.

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:27.270
And how am I supposed to do that?

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.510
I'm not a secret long-lost heiress
to some conglomerate, right?

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.640
There's no way for me to do that.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.410
Get into crypto.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.180
Seriously.

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:38.750
What are you,
a crypto ambassador now?

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.180
Are you getting a commission
or something?

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:44.820
It's the only chance people like us,
who weren't born rich,

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.020
have to make our lives better.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.990
A face mask would do you some good.
I'll put an aloe mask on you later.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.600
I doubt you borrowed that clunker
just to buy aloe masks,

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.500
so where'd you get
that piece of junk?

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.440
What did you blow your money on...

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.310
that you couldn't afford a rental?

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.650
I borrowed the car from my cousin,

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:13.620
and I splurged on a surfboard.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.920
The waves have just been
too good lately.

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:19.760
Honey.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:23.060
The waves you should worry about
are the coming waves of inflation.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.260
The infla-wave?
What are you talking about?

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.630
You just keep blowing your money
on stuff like that, all "YOLO."

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:31.330
And then Doom will say, "Hello"
and take over your life.

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:35.440
You were going "YOLO" and flexing.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.140
Why do you always pick on me?

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:39.270
Right back at you!
Mega bounce back!

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:42.310
Crystal bounce back!
Super-ultra backhole bounce back!

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:46.750
- Gosh. This is so embarrassing.
- Right back at you!

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:49.990
Hey, how can you act just like
a five-year-old?

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.990
Whenever I see you,
it's like a dam breaks...

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.190
and the nagging
just comes pouring out.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:56.990
- Right back at you!
- Just sit down already. Sit down.

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:01.830
Do you think your reckless spending
is a worthwhile indulgence?

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:04.970
A worthwhile indulgence?

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.800
As if you'd understand.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.310
I know little tricks
like this though.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.880
Da Hae, you can get up now.

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:22.420
So...

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.220
That's not bad.
You're sharper than you look.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.430
- Tteokbokki.
- Tteokbokki.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.060
Don't underestimate me.

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:34.530
Now just mix the drinks.

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:39.770
Alright, a glass for everyone.
Here we go.

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:43.170
- Tonight, the party doesn't...
- Stop!

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.520
What time is it?

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:02.690
Eun Sang.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:04.990
Ji Song. Hey, wake up.

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:09.300
- My stomach is killing me.
- How much did we drink last night?

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.700
Gosh, who knows?
This one kept pushing us to drink.

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:16.300
I was bummed out
that we couldn't go to the club.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.770
You said you knew a hot club,

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:20.110
but I checked,
and they were all shut down.

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:22.540
Just give me my phone already.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.310
In my bag over there.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.820
Okay, let's see...

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.160
- Hey, it's not in here.
- What?

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.260
- Seriously, where did you put it?
- It's not there?

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:45.100
- It's gone?
- I don't know!

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.310
I've tried calling all the numbers
you gave me,

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:54.080
but all three phones are off.

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.040
Darn it.

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.520
Gosh, Eun Sang. What is it?

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.690
- Did you remember something?
- I had it at the seafood place,

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.320
- Right.
- and then I used it at the cafe.

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:16.030
This is driving me crazy.

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:22.270
You spent money everywhere,
so you can't even narrow it down.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:24.440
Da Hae.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.640
Hey! Did you check the bar?
What'd they say?

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.380
It's not there.
They said nothing was turned in.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.510
Gosh, darn it.

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.350
Why did you have to collect
all our phones?

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:35.120
How was I supposed to know
this would happen?

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:42.490
What? What is it?
Did you just remember something?

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.060
No, it's just...

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:48.230
Remember that text from Dr. Ham?
I wonder what it was about.

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:50.800
- Seriously? At a time like this...
- No, I just...

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.400
I know this probably isn't the time,
but...

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.470
Then don't say it!

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:58.640
The trail entrance has set hours,
and we have to leave now.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:02.040
Maybe we can find our phones later
and just head out now?

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:05.580
Right, okay.
I mean, we told them about it,

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.320
so the desk'll call us
if they turn up.

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.280
We came all this way, after all.
Eun Sang, let's go.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.920
No, we have to find
our phones first.

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:12.990
Come on, let's just go. Please?

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:15.590
We'll miss the flowers
at Mount Deoksu, Eun Sang.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:17.260
We have to go now.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:19.690
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go!

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:20.760
- But...
- Let's go.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:22.830
- Let's go. Here's your bag.
- Fine.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:26.570
Let's go!
Let's go see the flowers! Come on!

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:39.610
When's it supposed to rain?
Someone check the forecast.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:41.780
Right. We don't have our phones.

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:43.620
I wonder what that text was.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:47.690
Should we listen to some music?
Just pull up YouTube.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.990
Right. The phones.

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.590
Gosh, what could it have been?

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:55.730
We can just listen to the radio.
The good old radio.

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:00.670
"Amor Fati"!
Your favorite song, Eun Sang.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.810
Life is now!

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.450
- Amor...
- We'll be back after a short break.

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:14.450
This program is brought to you by
Gimjinsa House's Number One Ribs.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.650
- We'll pick a few lucky texters...
- Ribs...

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.720
That sounds so good.

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:20.790
For some delicious ribs,
so keep those texts coming.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:24.530
Since then, crypto market volatility
has been alarming.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:28.260
I bet our investors won't be
getting any sleep tonight.

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:30.800
On that note,
let's listen to this next song.

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:33.900
"Regret" by Jo Sung Mo.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.070
Wait, what did the DJ just say?
"Alarming volatility?"

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:42.540
So, does that mean investors
are too excited or upset to sleep?

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:43.880
And why play the song "Regret?"

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.880
Do they regret investing?

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:48.150
Or do they regret not investing?

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:51.790
Eun Sang, don't tell me
the price dropped even more.

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:53.860
Hey, check the news!
See if there are any new articles!

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:54.990
Check the news with what?

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:59.060
Right.
What if we call the station and ask?

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:01.630
- With what phone?
- Seriously.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:02.830
Darn it.

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:07.540
Eun Sang!

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.010
What are you doing?

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.540
Who has time for flowers right now?
I need to get to a PC cafe.

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:14.640
I have to see what's going on.

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.850
A PC cafe is not on my itinerary.

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:18.750
And we can take our time to find it.

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:21.480
Take our time?
What if it crashes in the meantime?

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:24.920
Just think of it as a sign
from above to quit crypto.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.420
No deity has any business
sending me signs.

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.490
Unless he's here to apologize.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.230
What are you even talking about?
Just turn the car around already!

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:32.830
Look, if you don't get it,
then just stay out of it!

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:35.000
Come on, you two, stop fighting.
You're giving me a headache.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.300
Hey! Watch out!

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.270
Hey! Watch where you're going!

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.610
Look who's talking!
You came out of nowhere.

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.710
Excuse me?
Who do you think you're talking to?

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:49.110
- You!
- Eun Sang.

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:51.250
Let's just go.
This is going to turn into a fight.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:53.920
Move your car!
I need to get to a PC cafe!

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:55.320
Stop it. That's enough.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:59.620
Okay, that's enough. Stop.

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:01.390
- Eun Sang!
- She must be crazy. Let's go.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.660
What was that?
Was that the phone just now?

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:10.930
What?

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.070
It's nothing.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.370
Why are they in here?

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.440
Did you hide our phones?

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:36.220
The truth is that
I found it at the bar.

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:38.930
I was going to give it back to you
right away.

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:41.860
But then I thought,

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:43.670
You thought what?

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:47.370
You two were always on your phones.

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:51.470
Without them,
it finally felt like a real trip.

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:55.180
If you'd had your phones,
you'd just be checking your crypto.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.510
That's why I told you
to get in on it with us.

00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:01.080
Do you have any idea how much money
we're making off of this?

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:03.790
Seriously, it's always money with you.
Give it a rest.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:05.250
Do you know how pathetic
you both look...

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:06.320
going on about money like that?

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:07.520
What? Pathetic?

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:11.090
Hey, Kim Ji Song.
You'd better watch your mouth.

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:12.660
What did I say wrong?

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:15.300
It's not like
I'm making this stuff up.

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:17.670
You're the pathetic one here.

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:21.770
What did you just say?

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:22.900
Am I wrong?

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.070
Da Hae and I
didn't even need to get into crypto.

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:30.040
If we'd just kept working,
our salaries would've gone up a bit,

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.950
and maybe become
assistant managers one day.

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:35.120
I'm so jealous.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.420
But while we were climbing up,

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.450
earning titles
like manager and assistant manager,

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:40.960
what were you going to be doing?

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:42.720
I'm not interested in promotions.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.090
I'm fine with the way things are.

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:47.430
Right.

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:49.560
Of course,
that pathetic pride of yours...

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.830
You'd say things like, "I'm fine,"
or "I'm not greedy for money,"

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:54.870
but you know the truth.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.110
It's not that you're not ambitious.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.910
It's that you have no future.

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:01.610
Stop.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.880
You know it too. That's why you...

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.010
waste all your money
like it's your last day to live.

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:07.850
Because you know it's hopeless
to even try.

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.950
Because dreaming of
a better tomorrow...

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:15.690
Because you could never even dare
to dream of it.

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:18.630
Because you're an O.O.

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.330
What?

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.400
What do you mean, Ji Song's an O.O.?

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.000
You knew?

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:31.110
Wait a minute, what's going on?
What is it?

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:34.310
- Then how long have you known...
- You're repulsive.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.680
What?

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:39.280
You knew all along
and pretended you didn't know.

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:41.380
That's so repulsive.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.950
Then what was this trip about?

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:44.820
What, you wanted to give me charity?

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.090
Don't worry.

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:48.820
I didn't spend enough
to call it charity.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:50.890
I said I don't buy worthless things.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:52.230
Eun Sang.

00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:58.870
I'm sorry.

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:02.700
I guess I was being oblivious.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:06.840
I'll get out of your way now.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.480
So you can stop wasting money on me.

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.720
You two have a great time.

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:19.450
- Hey, where are you going?
- Just forget it. Let her go.

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:26.690
Come on.
Why did you say something so cruel?

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:29.200
And I suppose you were
so much nicer?

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.830
Gosh, okay, fine. Hold on.

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:32.930
Ji Song!

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:34.400
Ji Song?

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.200
Fine. Go on!

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.910
Think you're the only ones leaving?
I'm out of here too!

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:47.180
Unbelievable.

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.020
She's not even picking up. Goodness.

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.420
It's raining...

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.190
Of all the times for it to rain!
Seriously!

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:54.790
Wait a minute.

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:58.590
What?

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.360
Hey!

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.960
Hey, Ji Song!

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.300
Ji Song! Hey! What?

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:07.400
Wait! Hey!

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.200
Gosh, I can't believe her!

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:17.510
Hello.

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:21.080
Where can I take you?

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:23.550
That car up there... What?

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:24.750
Gosh, it's already gone.

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:26.020
Darn it.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.960
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.590
- Where to, ma'am?
- Right...

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.730
Just a moment.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.760
Gosh...

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.730
Yes, Mount Deokju, please.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:43.910
(You are now entering
Mount Deokju National Park.)

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:47.280
Gosh, I can't see a single thing!
Darn it.

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.480
Come on, please pick up.

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:56.180
Hey, Kim Ji Song!
Why aren't you answering your phone?

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.090
Probably because this isn't Ji Song.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:01.890
- Wait, Eun Sang?
- Ji Song and I switched phones.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:04.190
Because of our stupid,
similar keychains.

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.530
Is that any reason
not to answer the phone?

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:09.630
Whatever.
I'm already at Mount Deokju.

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:11.630
If you have any conscience at all,
you'll get over here.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.940
My conscience took a job
in the Middle East a long time ago.

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.610
If you find that brat,
tell her to bring me my phone.

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:21.780
Hello? Gosh, Kang Eun Sang!

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.580
Darn it.

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:27.580
Gosh, why'd she leave the car?
Does she expect me to drive it home?

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.350
Gosh...

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:43.030
(Eun Sang, Da Hae,
and Ji Song's trip)

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:44.670
(Kim Ji Sang)

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:46.130
(Eun Sang, Da Hae,
and Ji Song's trip)

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:09.090
(Eun Sang)

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.500
Hey, Kim Ji Song! Where are you?

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:17.570
How did you know
it was me right away?

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:19.000
Cut the crap!

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.940
I'm at Mount Deokju,
so get here now.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.770
Are you really going to ruin
our trip like this?

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:27.280
The trip isn't ruined, my heart is.
So, I'm afraid that's not happening.

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:29.840
Hey!
You were the one who planned this.

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:31.650
I came all the way here
because you planned it!

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:35.080
Sorry, but this is Eun Sang's phone,
so I can't talk for long.

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.520
She'll nitpick about something
for that.

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:39.520
I'm just a nobody to her anyway!

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:45.530
Darn it, hey!

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:48.530
Gosh, I can't with them. Seriously.

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:51.630
Now what?
Which way am I supposed to go?

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.620
This is insane...

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.270
(Ham Ji Woo)

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:34.680
- Hello?
- Why didn't you text me back?

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:37.810
Right.

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:40.050
It totally slipped my mind.

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:42.020
They just issued a
heavy rain warning.

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:44.550
You didn't go to the mountains,
did you?

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.490
Are you seriously on
a mountain right now?

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:52.690
Help me.

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:54.830
Da Hae!

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:09.710
And so...

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.250
and she called me pathetic...

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:14.750
and that I was just pitiful...

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:19.050
- She was so awful.
- Ji Song. Don't cry.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:23.090
- But you keep breaking up.
- What?

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:25.890
It's because this is
Eun Sang's phone.

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.400
She must be on
the cheapest data plan.

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:31.200
There's barely any data left.

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.740
I'll use her data, then cut her off.

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:36.840
Cut her off?

00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:39.040
I won't hang out with her anymore.

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:43.610
Because I was nice and admired her,
she thinks I have no worries...

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:46.710
From now on,
I'm ignoring her, even at work.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:47.880
Then...

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:52.250
What if you quit your job?
Just quit.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.420
Quit and just hang out with me.
It'll be fun.

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:56.920
We can go see the flowers in spring.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:57.960
How?

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:00.390
- What?
- No, I mean,

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.200
I'd love to hang out with you,

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.570
but if I quit my job,
where are we going to get the money?

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.570
Wait, are you saying we don't
need to rely on a salary...

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:12.440
because you have passive income
or something?

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:17.410
I just learned this yesterday.

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:20.110
Currently, there's high inflation
and low growth.

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:22.280
A ten-dollar bill
we save this year...

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.790
could be worth less than half that
by next year.

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:28.720
Just trying to save a little
here and there...

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.590
Wei Lin, you...

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:35.930
did you buy a watch?

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.270
What? You noticed?

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.400
Nice, right?
Want to get matching ones?

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:42.140
Matching couple's watches. Together?

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:43.900
Together, my foot.

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:47.210
Seriously? Aren't you worried about
the coming wave of inflation at all?

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:50.810
- Ji Song, I don't like nagging.
- What? Nagging?

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:55.250
Always new bags,
shoes, and wallets...

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:56.350
Where do you get the money for that?

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:58.090
Who knows what the future holds?

00:35:58.090 --> 00:35:59.250
How could you waste
your money like that?

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.990
Whenever I see you,
it's like a dam breaks...

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:03.420
and the nagging
just comes pouring out.

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:07.330
So that's what it was.

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:13.000
For the nagging to just come
pouring out like that,

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.270
it must mean
I really care about you.

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:26.310
(Namhae Bus Terminal,
Yongju Village)

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:29.250
(Mount Deokju)

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:31.190
Jung Da Hae.

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:35.520
If I was going to die
like this anyway,

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:41.400
why did I bother
saving money every month?

00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:46.570
Ms. Round! Snap out of it!

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:49.000
Ms. Round!

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:50.800
Mr. Ko?

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:54.540
You can't die out here! Get a grip!

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:57.240
You, worried about me?
That's a first.

00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:59.610
Is this a dream?

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:01.180
If you die,

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:06.850
I'll have no one to pick on at work.

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:08.460
Da Hae!

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:12.730
Da Hae, you need to snap out of it.
You can't die here.

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:16.230
- Da Hee?
- Even if life seems worthless,

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.700
even if you feel like
you're in the gutter,

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:19.030
you can never give up.

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:21.240
Is she trying to insult me?

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:23.970
I'm sorry, Da Hae.
I didn't mean any harm.

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:27.910
That felt pretty malicious to me.

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.010
Hey, you can't fall asleep.

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:31.650
Instead of me,

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:34.720
think about the person
you really want to see right now.

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:36.520
Why don't you think of that person?

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.220
Maybe that will help.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:40.350
Someone I want to see?

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:42.460
Jung Da Hae.

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:51.530
What is this now?

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:54.400
Even Dr. Ham now?

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:17.690
Are you hurt?

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.890
Can you get up?

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:26.530
No.

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:40.610
Get on my back.

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:51.360
Gosh, darn it.

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.530
My conscience...

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:56.460
picked a really bad time to show up.

00:38:58.070 --> 00:38:59.100
Gosh, you've got to be kidding me.

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:02.370
Where is Da Hae?
She's not even answering her phone.

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:03.770
Darn it.

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:08.440
(Assistant Manager Jo)

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.250
Gosh, why is she calling now?

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:15.820
(Assistant Manager Jo Su Jin)

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.480
Hello? Is this Kim Ji Song?

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:20.750
This isn't her.

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:22.460
Isn't this Kim Ji Song's phone?

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.990
Well, it is her phone.

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:27.160
What is that supposed to mean?

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:29.300
So is it her or not?

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:33.500
- I'm so busy too. Darn it.
- Just tell me. I'll pass it along.

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:35.000
Okay, fine.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:38.310
Can you ask Kim Ji Song
where this month's account chart is?

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:42.310
Also, ask if Mr. Ko got
the corporate card expense report.

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.140
Mr. Ko is on vacation today.

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:49.420
The nerve, taking a day off
when even the new hires haven't yet.

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:53.020
- I'm not doing that.
- What?

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:55.460
You should watch your own attitude.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:59.390
What gives you the right to call
and cuss me out?

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:00.690
Do you have a mouth full of razors?

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:01.760
Excuse me?

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:04.600
And another thing.
Is vacation just for Mr. Ko?

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:06.200
Kim Ji Song's on vacation too!

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:09.740
You have no manners calling someone
on their day off about work.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:11.540
Were you raised in a barn?

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:14.580
Listen to you.
Seriously, who is this?

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:15.680
Who do you think you are?

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:18.110
I'm Kim Ji Song's mother!

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:22.350
What do you think you're doing?

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:40.930
This trip has been
absolutely perfect.

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:45.040
What are you, a masochist?

00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:48.440
You were stranded,
and you're saying this was the best?

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:51.080
I'm serious.

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:56.850
Ji Song and Eun Sang had a fight,
so things got a little rocky,

00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.590
but on the whole,
it's all been great.

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:03.620
And now, to top it all off,
this dream is just perfect.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:06.760
A dream?

00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:08.400
You're supposed to be in Seoul,

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.760
but you're right here
in front of me.

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:12.900
What else could this be but a dream?

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:15.140
I need to wake up.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:16.970
Come on.

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:19.240
Wait a minute.

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:21.540
If it's a dream,
why do you want to wake up?

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:25.050
Am I not even allowed to be
in your dreams, Da Hae?

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:28.150
- No, it's not like that.
- Then what is it?

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.850
It's just that on this trip,

00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:34.120
I realized
how fun spending money is.

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:38.690
It was just so fun to spend
without a care in the world.

00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:41.600
Now that I know that feeling...

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:47.130
But still,
I want to savor this dream of you.

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:49.500
What?

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.140
You, Dr. Ham,

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:56.940
dreaming of you is a special treat
I have to save up for these days.

00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:01.420
Even thinking about you,
I feel like I have to ration it,

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:05.620
so I only let myself do it
a little bit at a time.

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:13.360
If my heart races too much at once,
I'm worried it'll be bad for me.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.570
So I do make your heart race.

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:25.010
Of course you do.

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:30.980
Because you're so darn handsome.

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.720
You're something else.

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:41.260
Oh, no!
I have to wake up now, for real!

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:42.260
Hey, wait!

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:43.490
- Wait, Da Hae, my neck!
- Let me wake up.

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:44.690
- My neck!
- Let me go!

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:46.930
My neck! Da Hae, my neck!

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.030
My tailbone...

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.330
What?

00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:55.540
This is a dream,
so why do I hurt too?

00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:00.010
Dr. Ham. Is this for real?

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:07.750
(Recent Call: Assistant Manager Jo)

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:10.180
Are you out of your mind?

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:12.420
You think I'm the insane one?
Not Assistant Manager Jo?

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:15.090
You're the one who just flipped out
on Ms. Jo with my phone.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.860
Hey, how is that my fault?

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:21.430
You shouldn't call staff on vacation
about work-related stuff.

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.200
It's totally out of line.

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:27.100
- But I'm an O.O.
- So what if you are?

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:30.040
An O.O is an indefinite contract.

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:32.570
We're not treated
like regular staff.

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:35.610
Our raises are different,
and so are the holiday bonuses.

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:37.780
During the holidays,
you guys complained about getting...

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:39.780
a measly fifty-dollar gift card, right?

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:43.150
An O.O. like me?
I don't even get that.

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:48.020
With things being the way they are,
do you really think I can afford to,

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:50.390
and raise chaos like you just did?

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:52.990
Hey, if that's your situation,

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:55.400
isn't that all the more reason
you should get into crypto?

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:57.130
Darn that stupid...
What? What did you say?

00:43:57.130 --> 00:43:58.470
If I get into your crypto,
what then?

00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:59.900
Will I get invited
to the group chat?

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:01.740
You'll stop caring about it.

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:04.070
Once you start making real money,

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:07.470
you won't care if they invite you
to some stupid group chat.

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.840
Your life is more than that chatroom,

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.150
in a much bigger and brighter world.

00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:16.980
Sure, it is.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.650
You want to talk about brilliant?
That would be Wei Lin's eyes.

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:21.990
And the way his teeth gleam
when he laughs.

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.260
Are you that obsessed with looks?

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:26.030
Good looks don't last forever.

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:29.530
Even if Wei Lin is
a pathetic human being.

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:33.330
He's the man I snagged amid a global
shortage of handsome men, all right?

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:37.470
He's a diamond. During Stagflation,
you couldn't buy him for any price!

00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:39.570
You...

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:42.540
You little brat.

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.880
You've been studying.

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:48.680
(High Inflation)

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:52.720
Shining down on me

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:54.990
(High Inflation, Low Growth)

00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:58.130
No, I haven't.

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:00.290
My gosh.

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:01.630
My gosh!

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:07.000
I feel like a proud mom
whose kid went from 300th to 299th.

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:10.470
I'm so proud of you.
You amazing little brat.

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:13.170
Get away from me. Get away!

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:14.240
My brilliant brat!

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:15.740
Get away from me. Get away!

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:25.790
Hey, hold on tight!

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:28.390
Let me go!

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.260
You think I'm just going to let go?

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:32.230
I would if I were you!

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:34.330
That's real noble of you.
You disloyal little brat.

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:38.330
We're both going to fall! Eun Sang!

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:40.770
Ji Song!

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:42.100
Ji Song!

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:44.240
And what is this supposed to be?

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.740
- Hey, hurry up...
- Eun Sang!

00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:50.910
- Hurry!
- Eun Sang!

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:53.710
Da Hae.

00:45:54.310 --> 00:45:55.320
What's going on here?

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:57.480
Hey, questions later. Just pull!

00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:59.650
- One, two, three!
- Two, three!

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:11.600
What in the world?

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:16.500
Hey.
Are vacations always this eventful?

00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:20.270
Exactly. Next time,
we're taking the train...

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:21.740
you mentioned to us.

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.580
And watch the dinner show
in one piece.

00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:28.420
But I think I must've hit my head
when I fell.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.620
Because now I'm starting
to see things.

00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:34.690
Isn't that Dr. Ham?

00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:38.990
Of all people to run into here,
it has to be my boss.

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:42.530
- What kind of nightmare is this?
- Are you all okay?

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:43.760
Good grief, what is it with you?

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:44.830
He's talking to us!

00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:46.730
Of course I am.
I was asking if you're okay.

00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:50.340
I thought I was dreaming
until a second ago, too.

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:51.670
Alright!

00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:55.910
Let's get it together
and just do what we practiced.

00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:57.410
It's about to come up.

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:05.420
There it is! It's up!

00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:09.460
What are you doing? Get up!
Come on, let's do this!

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.220
Come on, you know the one.
The thing we did that one time.

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:12.630
The routine we practiced.

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:14.830
Put your hands up!

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:17.530
Come on! Put your hands up!

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:19.970
- Put your, put your hands up!
- Right!

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:23.170
- Okay!
- Put your hands up!

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:27.310
- Put your hands up!
- Jump!

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:31.650
- Put your hands up!
- Put your hands up!

00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:33.450
- Put your hands up!
- Over here!

00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:37.920
(Namhae Jin Clinic)

00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:48.200
Eun Sang!
Are you awake? Are you feeling okay?

00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:54.840
What? What happened?

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.640
I got hurt and Ji Song fell,
so why are you the one who fainted?

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:01.640
- I fainted?
- Yes.

00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:04.040
The rescuers
on the helicopter said...

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:07.910
your cochlea and the part that
handles your sense of balance...

00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:10.920
are weak, so you could suddenly
pass out like that.

00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:14.120
In English?
So why exactly did I pass out?

00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:16.520
- It's because you're old.
- Darn it.

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:19.930
You had us worried.

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:21.930
I thought you were going to die.

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:26.070
Like I'd die... Hey, let go of me.

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:31.170
You were right about everything.

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:35.380
I'm a complete and total mess.
Nothing in my life has gone right.

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.280
Where's this suddenly coming from?

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:42.120
Hey, I wasn't that harsh, was I?

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:43.180
That's why...

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:46.690
That's why I hated
the idea of crypto.

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.490
You guys are all I have.

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:53.430
But then you...

00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:56.200
kept leaving me behind,

00:48:57.130 --> 00:48:59.700
and it felt like you were
taking off without me.

00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:03.970
That's the whole point.

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:07.170
We want you to do it with us.

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:08.680
But I'm scared.

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:12.780
- What?
- That my life...

00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:16.380
is so messed up that I have to cling
to a fad like that,

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:18.950
admitting that it's ruined.

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:21.890
That's what scares me.

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:25.030
We do this so we don't get ruined,
not because we are ruined.

00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:26.230
But my life is ruined!

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:27.890
It is ruined,
so why are you arguing?

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:30.630
It's a disaster.
A total, undeniable dumpster fire.

00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:34.230
Do you have any idea how high
my credit card bill is this month?

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:37.470
What, from the surfboard?
Come on, you only bought one thing.

00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:39.110
Why are you being so dramatic...

00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:42.240
- Right.
- I also bought a rash guard for it.

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:44.680
And a pair of shoes,

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:47.150
and a hat,

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.450
and a bag.

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:51.920
See? It's not one thing.
Why do you keep saying that?

00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:54.960
And when I snapped out of it,
I'd booked a flight to Guam, too.

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:56.020
Oh, dear.

00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:57.820
The thing is...

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:01.060
I've been crashing at a 24-hour spa
for the last three days.

00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:09.400
- Da Hae.
- Yes?

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:11.740
- Up my dose on the sedative.
- What?

00:50:11.810 --> 00:50:14.110
Just knock me out.
Or I'm going to strangle her.

00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:15.740
Okay, hold on. Got it.

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:17.780
Who told you to spend
that much money?

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.310
Save the lecture.
I don't want to hear it.

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:22.550
Right back at you!

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:25.250
Hey, knock it off!
This is a hospital. Be quiet.

00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:30.460
What's become of my life?
What am I going to do?

00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:33.590
Hey, be quiet!

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:38.230
Unbelievable.

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:40.200
Hey, you. Seriously.

00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:43.970
Do you have to act
like a five-year-old?

00:50:45.970 --> 00:50:49.010
Why do you keep treating
me like I'm five?

00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:51.380
You, Kim Ji Song.

00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:54.150
Because I...

00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:57.980
know a five-year-old
who's the spitting image of you.

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:00.520
How about I tell you her story
while the drugs kick in?

00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:06.790
This kid...

00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:11.030
is a little girl
who just turned five.

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:15.540
(Fairy Calia)

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:19.340
She was just starting
to learn to write,

00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:21.370
but she couldn't quite spell
her own name correctly.

00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:24.410
- She'd always get one letter wrong.
- It's so hot.

00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:27.010
So her name,

00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:28.310
- which was Ji Sang...
- What's this?

00:51:28.310 --> 00:51:29.420
Did you write your name?

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:31.850
One day, it would
come out as "Ji Seung,"

00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:35.120
and another day,
it'd even become "Ji Song."

00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:37.720
When did our little girl's
name become Ji Song?

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:40.790
I guess we'll have to call you
Ji Song from now on.

00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:42.730
Once she learned...

00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:43.730
- to write her name,
- Kim Ji Song.

00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:45.730
her parents had promised
to take her to an amusement park.

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.840
Her dad was a truck driver,

00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:53.670
and her mom was always busy
cleaning grills at a restaurant,

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:57.310
so they didn't have much
time to spend with her.

00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:00.050
So in her little mind,

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:02.420
if she could
just get her name right,

00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:06.490
she thought she could finally spend
a lot of time with her mom and dad.

00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:07.590
(Kim Ji Si)

00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:10.320
We left half an hour ago,
and it's already this backed up.

00:52:12.490 --> 00:52:13.490
Wednesday?

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:17.400
My husband works on Wednesdays,
so I have to watch our kid.

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:19.670
What about Friday? Okay.

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:23.240
Ji Sang.
That's dangerous. Sit down. Sit up.

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:24.540
Ji Sang, sit up straight.

00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:26.170
No, it's fine.

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:29.310
Okay, I'll see you then.
What about the pay?

00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:31.680
As long as the hourly rate is good,
I'm fine with it.

00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:33.710
So on the days...

00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:36.380
when it looked like
she'd finally written her name right,

00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:39.220
the poor parents' hearts
would just sink.

00:52:40.050 --> 00:52:42.790
This stroke sticks out
a bit too much here.

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:46.490
And this looks more like
a circle than a square.

00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:48.190
- Right. Darn it.
- And from then on,

00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:50.030
- That was so close. It's such a shame.
- they'd find fault with...

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:51.700
- Nope. Try again.
- whatever she wrote.

00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:58.870
Apparently, the kid would even sob
in her sleep sometimes.

00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:00.410
Now, don't you go crying
over something like that.

00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:01.880
It was just one stroke.

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:04.840
Just one little stroke
was drawn wrong.

00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:06.450
It's not that we don't want to go,
it's just...

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:14.650
Maybe we should try to make time?

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.760
We should. She wants to go so badly.

00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:27.300
Then one day,

00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:31.000
it was raining hard,
just like today.

00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:40.450
The little girl breathed
on the window...

00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:42.580
and wrote her name in the fog.

00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:45.120
Kim Ji Sang.

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:49.020
Perfectly, without a single mistake.

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:51.520
Finally.

00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:54.230
So? Did they go
to the amusement park?

00:53:54.790 --> 00:53:56.330
They must have gone after that,
right?

00:53:56.830 --> 00:53:57.830
No.

00:53:58.500 --> 00:53:59.530
They couldn't.

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:01.400
Why not?

00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:06.110
Because they saw it in the car
on their way back from burying her.

00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:10.880
(Kim Ji Sang)

00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:15.380
(Kim Ji Sang)

00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:29.760
It was an accident.

00:54:30.130 --> 00:54:32.330
Her preschool bus crashed
into a guardrail.

00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:35.740
If only they'd had
a little more time,

00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:40.070
they would've had so many chances
to praise her.

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:42.340
If only they'd had more money,

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:48.410
she could have had so many more
wonderful experiences.

00:54:51.550 --> 00:54:53.650
The mother, who regretted...

00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:56.620
the moments
she could never get back,

00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.190
was just barely going through
the motions of living.

00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:07.270
Until one day, like a miracle,
she met them again.

00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:09.800
Those two little strokes.

00:55:11.570 --> 00:55:13.170
They weren't failures.

00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:16.140
They were just strokes
that weren't finished yet.

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:19.850
They weren't drawn wrong.

00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:21.780
They were just clumsy,

00:55:22.550 --> 00:55:23.950
very slowly,

00:55:24.550 --> 00:55:27.490
and carefully drawn lines
that were still a work in progress.

00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:32.160
So you see, Kim Ji Song.

00:55:33.690 --> 00:55:35.560
What makes you think
you're a failure?

00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:39.470
You have endless possibilities.
You can be whatever you want to be.

00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:41.900
You're still a work in progress.

00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:44.800
Isn't it a little premature...

00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:46.610
to call yourself a failure?

00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:51.140
You're right.

00:55:52.450 --> 00:55:53.450
It is.

00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:57.220
I'm not ready
to call myself a failure.

00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:02.220
Listen,

00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:04.460
I...

00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:07.430
still don't know the first thing
about crypto,

00:56:08.330 --> 00:56:10.130
but I'll trust you
and give it a shot.

00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:12.530
And for once,

00:56:12.970 --> 00:56:14.430
I'm going to believe
in the person who believes in me.

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:19.910
I'll get into crypto too.

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:26.710
What?

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:28.550
Wait, don't tell me...

00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:31.720
the train has already left.

00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:38.090
- First, just download the app.
- What?

00:56:39.090 --> 00:56:40.490
Once you create your account,

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:44.500
I'll send you five of my coins.
No, make that ten.

00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:47.870
That's worth around 8,700 dollars.

00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:50.400
Wait, can you really give me
that much?

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:51.570
Are you sure you don't mind?

00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:54.710
Mind? Of course not.
I call this a worthy indulgence.

00:56:55.410 --> 00:56:56.410
Eun Sang...

00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:57.910
Me too.

00:56:58.310 --> 00:56:59.810
I'll throw in five, too.

00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:02.320
You guys...

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.250
Forget 8,500 dollars.

00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:08.550
Let's make it 85,000 dollars.
No, let's go for 100,000 dollars!

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:11.790
- To the moon!
- To the moon!

00:57:12.490 --> 00:57:14.030
Huddle up, everyone. Come on.

00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:17.330
- Here we go again.
- Let's go! To the moon!

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:19.430
- Oh, my.
- Let's go! To the moon!

00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:21.630
- To the moon!
- Let's go! To the moon!

00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:23.540
That's how it always was.

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.540
Whenever I wanted something,
the first thing I'd think was...

00:57:28.210 --> 00:57:30.180
"Do I really need that right now?"

00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:32.510
The answer was always
pretty much the same.

00:57:33.050 --> 00:57:34.550
Maybe later.

00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:36.480
Sometime down the road.

00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:40.820
The easiest thing to deny myself
was my own heart.

00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:44.490
But I decided not to do
that anymore.

00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:48.960
With these great people by my side,
I'll let myself be completely happy.

00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:53.030
After all, we're all more than
deserving of it.

00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:05.040
What is this?

00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:08.950
They sure are having a great time
in their own little bubble.

00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:10.850
No, we're not.

00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:24.630
(Marron Confectionery)

00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:29.940
The doors are opening.

00:58:35.370 --> 00:58:36.810
The doors are closing.

00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:57.930
Maybe it's my first day back,
but this feels a little awkward.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.630
Are you sure it's not me
that's making it awkward?

00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:06.640
- Are you sulking?
- Of course I am.

00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:09.640
- Why?
- Because you shot me down.

00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:11.310
By saying we should just be friends.

00:59:12.610 --> 00:59:14.210
- Boo.
- The doors are opening.

00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:28.900
- The doors are closing.
- Wait, hold on!

00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:32.770
Wait, this is
the executive elevator.

00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:36.440
I should be the one who's baffled,
not you.

00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:38.270
Didn't you say
you wanted to be friends?

00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:41.670
I did.

00:59:42.510 --> 00:59:45.110
But how is wanting to be friends
the same as rejecting you?

00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:46.180
You mean it isn't?

00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:53.620
Dr. Ham, you're...

00:59:54.050 --> 00:59:55.350
way out of my league.

00:59:55.350 --> 00:59:56.760
I get it, okay? I already got it.

00:59:57.090 --> 00:59:58.360
How many more times
must I hear that?

00:59:58.860 --> 00:59:59.990
Goodness.

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:03.400
Could you stop cutting me off?
What are you, a conversation killer?

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:08.630
Dr. Ham...

01:00:08.970 --> 01:00:10.700
you really are
an extraordinary person.

01:00:11.070 --> 01:00:13.470
You're cool and incredibly capable.

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:17.380
But still, I want to see
where this goes.

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:19.480
With you, Dr. Ham.

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:29.860
I don't mean
we should just remain friends.

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:33.360
I'm saying we should start
as friends.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.730
Whatever challenges come our way,

01:00:38.730 --> 01:00:39.770
I say we...

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.430
take it on.

01:00:43.970 --> 01:00:45.340
Even if we get shipwrecked,

01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:48.410
let's treat it like
an exciting adventure...

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:50.740
and enjoy it.

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:56.280
Together...

01:00:59.090 --> 01:01:00.090
Gosh...

01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:03.220
What?

01:01:04.690 --> 01:01:05.690
I'd like that.

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:08.860
I said it's fine.
Stranded, adventure, whatever.

01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:10.960
As long as I'm with you,
Jung Da Hae.

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:12.900
Why even ask when it's so obvious?

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:14.270
Gosh...

01:01:19.770 --> 01:01:20.770
Right.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.740
By the way, how did you
get to Namhae that day?

01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:27.380
Well?

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:31.350
- Remind me why we came to Namhae?
- For a creative retreat.

01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:34.990
You know how famous musicians,
when they get writer's block,

01:01:35.050 --> 01:01:38.390
they just take off for somewhere new
and come back with timeless hits.

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:40.760
I guess it's not a bad approach.

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:42.730
But we'll be back by Friday, right?

01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:45.000
I have to get to my part-time job.
Don't you have that important thing?

01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:48.030
With the Vietnam branch.
That signing ceremony or whatever.

01:01:48.030 --> 01:01:49.900
Yes, of course,
we'll be back by then.

01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:51.040
It's important.

01:01:52.410 --> 01:01:54.510
- Let's take a picture over there!
- I'll go ask someone.

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:55.810
- It's so pretty!
- What?

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:57.910
Don't just say that.
How about that over there?

01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:59.310
- That one's good, right?
- It seems okay, I guess.

01:01:59.310 --> 01:02:00.880
Hello. Excuse me,

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:03.180
would you mind taking a picture
for us?

01:02:06.450 --> 01:02:08.490
You don't have to do all that.

01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:11.690
- This angle makes your legs longer.
- Thank you.

01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:19.630
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:20.700
Thank you.

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:22.840
Thank you.

01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:25.170
- Have a safe trip.
- Selfie time!

01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:27.740
Selfie time!

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.180
- You picked a great restaurant.
- I know, right?

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.790
They sure know how to find a pricey,
but tasty, spot.

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:44.460
- What else should we order?
- You guys want some shrimp?

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:48.260
What?
This place is famous for abalone.

01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:50.830
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:53.530
Can a customer treat everyone here?

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.330
- Excuse me?
- I'd like to buy...

01:02:55.330 --> 01:02:57.700
an order of abalone
for all the tables.

01:02:59.510 --> 01:03:02.240
He lay down flat
on the ground just to get the shot.

01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:05.380
Look at her, having fun.

01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:14.350
Excuse me?

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.160
Hello.

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:21.030
I just wanted to ask you something.

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:22.090
Yes?

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.860
Do you know of any clubs
around here?

01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:26.100
Like, a popular one
with a good crowd?

01:03:26.170 --> 01:03:27.600
There are no clubs.

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.870
They're all closed.
So just go, okay? Go!

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.370
- Go on.
- Why are you getting so mad?

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.410
I'm not getting angry, it's just...

01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:35.440
Just go! Go!

01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:37.640
This guy's ridiculous.

01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:42.310
You're trying way too hard.

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.380
Help me!

01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:46.820
Da Hae?

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:48.750
Da Hae!

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:52.220
You startled me.

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:53.560
What is it?

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:55.260
What are you doing?

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.360
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:58.460
Aren't we going back to Seoul?

01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:00.000
She's obviously in danger.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.330
Are you telling me
to just leave her?

01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:02.800
Hey, what about
the signing ceremony?

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:05.100
We'll be late even if we leave now.

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:08.410
If you don't go back to Seoul now,
you're going to be in real trouble.

01:04:08.410 --> 01:04:10.180
It's not like
you're the owner's son.

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:11.210
If you mess up
something this important,

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.380
do you really think
you'll keep your job?

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:15.650
- Whatever.
- What?

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.680
Tell them to go ahead and fire me.

01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:20.290
Are you serious? Hey!

01:04:20.550 --> 01:04:22.960
Hey! Ham Ji Woo! Hey!

01:04:23.090 --> 01:04:24.960
Is he crazy or what?

01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:26.060
Hello?

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:28.130
I'm asking how you ended up
in Namhae.

01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:29.900
I don't feel like getting into that.

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:33.330
But let's agree on one thing.

01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:36.300
What kind of promise?

01:04:36.370 --> 01:04:39.000
I'm fine with starting as friends
and going slow,

01:04:39.570 --> 01:04:41.840
- but let's not hold back too much.
- Hold back on what?

01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:43.180
My feelings.

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.450
From now on,

01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:48.810
don't be afraid to overdo it.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.620
Because I'm certainly
not holding back.

01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:58.220
Okay.

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:15.140
What is this?

01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:17.140
What is it? Something interesting?

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:18.510
I don't know about that.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:20.610
It's probably not...

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:23.680
very interesting to you.

01:05:24.450 --> 01:05:25.480
What is it?

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:27.950
(Hoppang Bite)

01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:29.150
The doors are opening.

01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:59.590
(To the Moon)

01:06:11.530 --> 01:06:14.800
(Kim Ji Sang)

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.370
(Special thanks to Yoon Kyung Ho
and Zhang Hao)

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:22.440
Why do those people keep
whispering like that?

01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:25.180
Is it because of that?
Just say it's real.

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:27.310
Friends? Is that a problem?

01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:28.480
Even if we're not equals at work...

01:06:28.550 --> 01:06:29.780
Hey, Kim Ji Song!

01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:30.850
From now on, you're paying.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:34.120
- What?
- I'll collect every last penny.

01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:36.860
It just keeps dropping.

01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:40.430
When crypto prices drop,
that's your signal to buy more.

01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:41.730
We're not doing this for nothing.

01:06:41.730 --> 01:06:43.530
We can't get by
on our salaries alone.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:46.200
- What is this?
- Da Hae, do you invest in crypto?

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:49.500
Watch Ms. Round like a hawk.

01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:51.300
Mr. Ko is already on my case.

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:53.410
If he finds out about this,

01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:54.870
I'm dead meat.

01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:01.010
