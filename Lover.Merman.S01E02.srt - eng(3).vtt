[Previously]

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.010
My name is Phurich.

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.280
I'm Nava.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.610
This is Phurich,
my best friend from Bangkok.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.820
From now on,
Phurich will be working here with us.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.500
Phu is a real player.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.250
He flirts with everyone.
If you can, just avoid him.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.970
I don't want to see my little brother
get his heart broken.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.880
As for Phu, if he ever found out the truth, he wouldn't be able to handle it.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.940
Is there something you need?

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.820
I'm supposed to start
my internship here tomorrow.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.050
An intern is starting at the bar tomorrow.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.630
He's all yours. I don't like training people.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.390
I'd advise you not to touch that.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.310
What kind of fish does this scale come from?

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.040
If I told you it was a merman's scale, would you believe me?

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.310
I'd have to be crazy to believe that.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.490
On the night before a full moon,

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.600
an eight-pointed star is supposed to appear
on each of their bodies.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.870
If someone can show me a real, live merman, then I'll believe them.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.840
- Hey, Maiek.
- Yes?

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.180
Close up the bar for me, will you?

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.930
I'm going to take some customers out. Thanks.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.220
- No problem.
- And clear my glass for me.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.020
You got it.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.830
Hey, Nava. Are you heading back?

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.930
I can give you a ride.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.260
Could I just sit here for a little longer?

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.770
Okay, then. I'll wait for you on the shore.

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.620
Okay.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.720
See you in a bit.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.280
Okay.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.880
I'm heading off.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.380
A merman?

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.940
Phurich!

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.250
I shouldn't have drunk so much.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.750
Ugh...

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.720
How did I even get back here?

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.790
I really shouldn't have drunk that much.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.470
This hangover is brutal.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.890
And I'm in a hurry, too.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.230
Hey!

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.040
What a terrible start to the day.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.650
Should I call my insurance?

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.450
I don't think that's the first thing
you should be saying to me.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.550
Look, I'm in a real hurry. I'm not looking for any trouble.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.424
I don't care if you're in a hurry.

00:07:33.424 --> 00:07:36.754
And I'm not looking for trouble
with your kind, either.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.600
"My kind?" What is that supposed to mean?

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.210
The kind of person who makes a mistake
and doesn't apologize.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.880
What kind of person
do you think that makes you?

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.380
Oh, really?

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:50.720
Well, one thing's for sure.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.770
At least I'm not the one who starts
with snide remarks, unlike you.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.740
Look, about what happened with the car,
I'm sorry.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.940
I was driving carelessly.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.620
My car just has a little scratch. It's fine.

00:08:23.833 --> 00:08:27.572
Oh, and one more thing.

00:08:27.572 --> 00:08:29.580
Even if you did call your insurance,

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.610
no agent would bother dragging themselves
all the way out here.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.096
Don't forget, this is an island, not Bangkok.

00:08:36.096 --> 00:08:38.696
The people here don't live like you do.

00:08:40.111 --> 00:08:41.911
Excuse me.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.300
Are you Nava?

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.842
Yes. And you are?

00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:12.299
He's my younger brother, Ping.

00:09:12.299 --> 00:09:14.524
Phana asked us both to look after him.

00:09:14.524 --> 00:09:16.430
He'll be working behind the bar.

00:09:17.118 --> 00:09:18.718
Of course.

00:09:19.456 --> 00:09:21.200
If there's anything you need, just ask.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.200
Okay, thank you.

00:09:28.442 --> 00:09:31.128
Getting the bar's number one bartender
to show him the ropes.

00:09:31.128 --> 00:09:33.481
My brother is so lucky.

00:09:33.481 --> 00:09:35.100
Oh, Ping.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.998
Could you take the bottles out of that crate
and arrange them on the bar for me?

00:09:37.998 --> 00:09:39.749
I'll be right back.
I'm just going to the kitchen.

00:09:39.749 --> 00:09:41.649
You got it.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.370
So, Ping, are you from around here?

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.950
Yes, but I went to the mainland for school.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.170
I only come back once in a while.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:58.380
Why do you ask? Do I not look like a local?

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:02.020
I'm pretty sure we've never met before,

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:05.340
but for some reason,
there's something familiar about you.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.960
Yeah, I feel the same way.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.970
You can put all the non-soda mixers in here.

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.300
It makes them easier to grab for customers.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.770
Also, can you tell Timmy we need more whiskey
restocked at the front bar?

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:22.470
You got it.

00:10:29.399 --> 00:10:31.020
Nava.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.293
Yes?

00:10:32.293 --> 00:10:33.920
Has Phana gotten in yet?

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.250
He should have arrived by now.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.740
Are you hungover, Phurich?

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.980
Are you worried about me?

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:54.170
Anyone who saw the state you're in
would think the same thing.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:02.170
Then what do I have to do
to make you actually worry about me?

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.520
And why would I need to worry about you?

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.800
Because I like you.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:16.470
This is Ping.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.620
Phana hired him as an intern.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.710
- This is Phurich. He's--
- Are you Nava's boyfriend?

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.600
- No.
- Yes.

00:11:24.629 --> 00:11:26.360
But I will be soon.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.650
This is Phurich, Phana's friend and a co-owner of the bar.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.070
My apologies, Phurich.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.380
You're in early today.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.243
Don't hit me. My head is already killing me.

00:11:54.243 --> 00:11:57.193
I had to do way too many shots
with customers last night.

00:11:57.875 --> 00:12:01.770
Here, you should have
the standard staff remedy for that.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.030
Nava.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:06.610
Could you get a hot honey lemon drink
for Phurich?

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:08.280
Of course.

00:12:14.149 --> 00:12:15.949
Hey, Phana.

00:12:16.699 --> 00:12:19.129
Last night, I think...

00:12:21.008 --> 00:12:23.258
I saw something.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.370
It looked like a merman.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.570
Excuse me.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.470
What are you rambling about, Phu?

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.100
There's no such thing as mermaids.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.340
That's what I thought, too.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:45.840
But I'm telling you,
my eyes weren't playing tricks on me.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:50.000
Where did you see it?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.700
Last night.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:55.470
After I left the customers,

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:58.030
I went to sit by the beach.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.630
Even though I couldn't see it clearly,

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:06.480
I'm confident that's what it was.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.180
A merman?

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:38.420
But thinking back on it, it looked like...

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.020
Looked like what?

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:00.790
Like...

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:04.090
Oh, Phurich.

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:06.330
Sober now, are we?

00:14:09.468 --> 00:14:11.144
You shouldn't pass out drunk like that again.

00:14:11.144 --> 00:14:12.805
You're going to get sick.

00:14:12.805 --> 00:14:14.213
What are you talking about, Lek?

00:14:14.213 --> 00:14:17.143
Well, last night, I was on my way to meet a friend at the beach,

00:14:17.143 --> 00:14:21.080
and I happened to find Phurich
passed out drunk on the sand.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.020
Oh, Phu.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:27.500
Turns out you were just drunk
and dreaming that you saw a merman.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.232
Let me tell you something.

00:14:34.232 --> 00:14:36.089
This isn't Bangkok, you know.

00:14:36.089 --> 00:14:40.349
You can't just get wasted
and easily grab a taxi home.

00:14:40.349 --> 00:14:43.468
Even if the people on this island are harmless,

00:14:43.468 --> 00:14:47.350
it doesn't mean it's completely safe
for a newcomer like you.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:51.562
Yeah... I'm sorry.

00:14:51.562 --> 00:14:54.602
I'll take better care of myself from now on.

00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:56.545
Good.

00:14:56.545 --> 00:14:58.300
And thank you for last night, Lek.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:59.800
Of course.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.569
What Phu was talking about...

00:15:13.569 --> 00:15:15.280
was he talking about you, Nava?

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.847
Um...

00:15:16.847 --> 00:15:19.240
You knew, Phana?

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.860
It was pretty obvious.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.731
Yesterday, I swam a little too far
from the hidden beach.

00:15:24.731 --> 00:15:26.985
I didn't think anyone would see me.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:39.404
It's okay.

00:15:39.404 --> 00:15:41.760
But I don't want you to be careless, either.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:46.510
Nowadays, there aren't many people left
on the island who know about merfolk.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.470
And it's best if we keep it that way,

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:52.190
for your own safety.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.750
I'll be more careful from now on.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.831
Speaking of which,
are you going to see Den today?

00:16:03.831 --> 00:16:05.656
I'm heading out now anyway.

00:16:05.656 --> 00:16:07.360
Do you want a ride?

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.530
No, that's okay. I'd rather take my motorbike.

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:13.040
That way, I can get back quickly
to prep the bar.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.590
Okay, then. I'm heading out.

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.820
- Okay.
- Be safe.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:42.270
I was just about to head into town for a bit.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.384
Can I tag along?

00:16:45.279 --> 00:16:47.830
I'm just going to the barbershop. That's it.

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:49.102
That's fine.

00:16:49.102 --> 00:16:51.550
I'll go to the barbershop with you.

00:16:52.833 --> 00:16:56.013
It would be more convenient for you
to take your own car.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.910
You don't pull any punches, do you?

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.600
Let me ask you something directly.

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.116
Everything you're doing...

00:17:13.116 --> 00:17:15.176
Are you hitting on me?

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:25.711
Yes.

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:27.860
I'm hitting on you.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.420
I apologize if I gave you the wrong impression
the other day.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.900
I honestly just thought you were a customer.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.980
I was just playing along
like any bartender would.

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.190
I never meant to make you think
it was more than that.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:44.757
So what?

00:17:44.757 --> 00:17:47.040
I genuinely like you.

00:17:50.385 --> 00:17:52.895
And what is it about me that you like?

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.896
Well...

00:17:58.896 --> 00:18:01.060
I don't really know.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:04.290
I just have this feeling
that if I let you get away,

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:07.400
it would be the biggest regret of my life.

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:14.990
In that case,
I'm tired of having this conversation with you.

00:18:25.618 --> 00:18:28.018
What is it now, Grandpa?

00:18:30.354 --> 00:18:32.884
Don't tell me you're out of gas.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:40.730
Do you need a ride?

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:45.120
But aren't you in a hurry?

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.180
You said you had to get to the bar.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.180
I am one of the owners now.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:52.690
And I'm very strict about employees being late.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.260
Fine.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:09.170
But could you please let go of my arm?

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:13.230
Right.

00:19:19.143 --> 00:19:20.843
Lead the way.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.269
Um... I'm sorry.

00:20:17.269 --> 00:20:19.930
I didn't mean to be rude.

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:22.200
I haven't said anything.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.966
Oh, right.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:27.640
So, how was your first day of work?

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:28.710
It was good.

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:32.040
Timmy and Nava taught me everything
step-by-step.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:36.330
For now, I'm just trying to get familiar
with where everything is.

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:38.290
That's good.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:42.070
Just learn at your own pace.
If you get confused, just ask.

00:20:47.119 --> 00:20:49.909
Okay, thank you.

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.765
Oh, Timmy, perfect timing.

Does Phana normally drink at this time of day?

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.670
"Normally?" Of course not.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:15.363
If he's drinking at this hour,
he definitely had a fight with Namhom.

00:21:15.363 --> 00:21:16.959
Namhom?

00:21:16.959 --> 00:21:19.357
Yeah, his girlfriend.

00:21:19.357 --> 00:21:21.703
They fight constantly.

00:21:21.703 --> 00:21:23.134
But he really loves her.

00:21:23.134 --> 00:21:26.486
I see them argue all the time, like twice a week,

00:21:26.486 --> 00:21:28.823
but they never actually break up.

There are only a few on the island.

feel free to call me anytime.

I'll just walk around town while I wait.

But I don't have your number.

Wow, Den. I love it.

Are you here for a haircut, too?

Oh, no.

00:23:54.075 --> 00:23:56.750
Den asked me to order wine from the mainland,
so I just came to drop it off.

- Here you go.
- Thanks.

I actually ordered your wine, too,

but I forgot to bring it.
I didn't think you'd be here.

You look even more handsome.

00:24:13.858 --> 00:24:16.066
Isn't that a bit of an exaggeration, Nava?

00:24:16.066 --> 00:24:18.090
Is it?

00:24:18.829 --> 00:24:20.440
And you're not going to compliment the barber?

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:24.700
You know,
I really put my all into this haircut.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:28.800
Oh, that goes without saying, Den.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:31.740
By the way,

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:37.400
have you two heard the rumor about humans coming to our island to hunt merfolk?

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.036
Den, where did you hear that?

00:24:43.036 --> 00:24:46.080
The last time I went to shed my toxins,

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:51.686
I overheard some of the others saying that
a few of our kind have gone missing.

00:24:51.686 --> 00:24:55.686
About two or three of them, sometime last week.

00:24:55.686 --> 00:24:59.445
And you two haven't heard anything about this?

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:08.320
I'll have to check with my father about this.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:19.207
Just as I'd expect from the chief's son.

00:25:19.207 --> 00:25:21.843
He never lets anything slide.

00:25:21.843 --> 00:25:23.553
That's just how Phraphai is.

00:25:23.553 --> 00:25:25.448
He worries about every single merperson
on this island.

00:25:25.448 --> 00:25:27.248
Hmm...

00:25:27.248 --> 00:25:29.962
I wouldn't say "every" merperson.

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:40.260
My father said he's heard the rumors as well,

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:44.097
and there's a very high chance
that they're true.

00:25:44.097 --> 00:25:48.779
But so far, there's no proof that they are specifically hunting merfolk.

00:25:49.434 --> 00:25:53.110
So how seriously should I be taking this?

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:55.320
Tell me, Phraphai.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.160
Phraphai.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:03.990
Does that mean we have to go back
into hiding like before?

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:57.157
Nava, you're exaggerating.

00:29:57.157 --> 00:29:59.740
You'll make Phurich think I'm arrogant.

00:30:00.944 --> 00:30:03.204
I wouldn't think that, Phraphai.

00:30:03.204 --> 00:30:05.300
Because on this island,

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.314
Nava is the only one
I'm interested in.

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:11.552
Listen.

00:30:11.552 --> 00:30:13.664
If you can see a crash coming,

00:30:13.664 --> 00:30:16.200
I'd suggest you back off now.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.300
Because there's no insurance
that will cover this.

00:30:31.196 --> 00:30:32.508
What's going on here?

00:30:32.508 --> 00:30:34.345
You two getting acquainted?

00:30:34.345 --> 00:30:36.127
Hello, Phana.

00:30:36.127 --> 00:30:38.720
Hey, Chief. Have you been busy?

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.920
I haven't seen you stop by.

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:44.531
I just got back to the island a few days ago.

00:30:44.531 --> 00:30:47.130
Are you heading out now, Phraphai?

00:30:47.832 --> 00:30:49.727
Actually, I've changed my mind.

00:30:49.727 --> 00:30:51.507
I think I'll stay for a glass of wine.

00:30:51.507 --> 00:30:53.204
Oh, perfect.

00:30:53.204 --> 00:30:57.154
I wanted to talk to you
about the new shipping boat anyway.

00:30:57.154 --> 00:30:58.540
I'd be happy to.

00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:01.500
In that case, I'll wait for you inside.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.180
Let's go.

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:06.230
See you inside.

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:11.560
What the hell are you thinking?

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.160
Tell me.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.630
Do you remember what I told you this morning about having a problem

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:17.801
before getting to the bar?

00:31:17.801 --> 00:31:20.980
He's the one I had a problem with.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.626
Hey, Phu,

00:31:23.626 --> 00:31:25.347
what kind of problem?

00:31:25.347 --> 00:31:27.050
What trouble did you get into now?

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:28.650
Hey!

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:36.540
Ping, can you top me up?

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:44.120
- Maiek.
- Yeah?

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.000
Let me ask you something.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.063
That guy sitting next to Phana, who is he?

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:52.510
Oh, that's Phraphai.

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:55.450
He's the son of the chief of Koh Khen.

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:57.740
He owns all the fishing fleets on the island.

00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:00.180
He's a pretty big deal around here.

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:05.341
He's nice, good-looking, and rich.

00:32:05.341 --> 00:32:07.370
Plus, he and Phana have been close
since they were kids.

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:10.930
But then again, Koh Khen is a small island.

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:13.510
So he's friends with Nava?

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:19.476
To Nava, Phraphai is like another older brother.

00:32:19.476 --> 00:32:22.520
- An older brother?
- Yeah.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.680
But it's not the same
as his relationship with Phana.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.780
How should I put it...

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.500
Well, to be honest,

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.920
they seem more like a couple than brothers.

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:36.450
People say that Phraphai is in love with Nava.

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:40.130
Oh.

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:42.030
Thanks.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.330
So Phraphai likes Nava.

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:47.361
- Yeah.
- But what about Nava? Does he like him back?

00:32:47.361 --> 00:32:49.851
That's the million-baht question.

00:32:49.851 --> 00:32:53.797
It's a shame no one knows
how Nava really feels.

00:32:53.797 --> 00:32:55.560
I'd like to know, too.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.619
Everyone at the bar can see how close they are.

00:32:57.619 --> 00:33:01.653
But, Phu, you're asking a lot of questions about Nava.

00:33:01.653 --> 00:33:03.718
You have a crush on him?

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.400
Yes. I like Nava.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.040
And I'm going to win him over.

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:17.340
I'm rooting for you.

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.280
Go for it.

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:36.193
Thanks for the ride.

00:33:36.193 --> 00:33:37.893
Of course.

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:56.440
Nava.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:58.820
Yes?

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:01.020
Can I talk to you for a second?

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:04.220
Sure.

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:08.650
What kind of person is Phurich?

00:34:09.961 --> 00:34:10.939
He's...

00:34:10.939 --> 00:34:12.981
playful and a little cheeky.

00:34:12.981 --> 00:34:14.830
Overall, he seems like a good person.

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:18.140
And is he pursuing you?

00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.820
Let me ask you something directly.

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:25.640
Everything you're doing...
Are you hitting on me?

00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:30.727
Yes.

00:34:30.727 --> 00:34:33.080
I'm hitting on you.

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.460
I think he is.

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:41.490
At first, I thought he was just messing around,

00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:45.020
but when I asked him about it,
he said he was serious.

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.660
And...

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.400
And how do you feel about it, Nava?

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:55.160
I don't feel anything.

00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:58.650
A relationship between Phurich
and me is impossible.

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:03.250
Besides, Phana also told me that Phurich is a huge player.

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.870
Well, I hope that's really how you feel.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.202
You don't need to worry, Phraphai.

00:35:12.202 --> 00:35:16.330
If I don't play along, he'll get tired and give up eventually.

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:21.196
Nava, let me be blunt with you.

00:35:21.196 --> 00:35:23.076
Aside from Phana,

00:35:23.076 --> 00:35:26.464
I don't want you to trust any other human.

00:35:26.464 --> 00:35:28.560
Don't forget

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:32.230
the deep scars humans have left on our kind.

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:36.934
I understand.

00:35:36.934 --> 00:35:39.636
I won't trust anyone that easily.

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:43.160
Okay. You should get some sleep.

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:46.340
Alright. Drive home safely.

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:27.440
And is he pursuing you?

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:32.020
I think he is.

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.150
Don't forget

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:37.710
the deep scars humans have left on our kind.

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:42.180
I understand.

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:44.880
I won't trust anyone that easily.

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:52.250
Everything you're doing...

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:54.550
Are you hitting on me?

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.703
Yes.

00:37:01.703 --> 00:37:04.360
I'm hitting on you.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:07.490
I don't want to see you get hurt in the end.

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:09.135
Phu is a real player.

00:37:09.135 --> 00:37:12.090
He flirts with everyone.
If you can, just avoid him.

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:13.690
Besides,

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:16.390
I don't want to see my little brother
get his heart broken.

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:21.440
As for Phu, if he ever found out the truth, he wouldn't be able to handle it.

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:28.890
What are you rambling about, Phu?

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:31.560
There's no such thing as mermaids.

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.765
That's what I thought, too.

00:37:33.765 --> 00:37:36.080
But I'm telling you,

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.365
my eyes weren't playing tricks on me.

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:56.756
Nava,

00:37:56.756 --> 00:37:58.957
what's wrong, sweetheart?

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:05.910
Mom... I don't want to play with Phana anymore.

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:11.610
He said he's afraid of me because I'm a merman.

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:17.570
Why would he suddenly be afraid of me?

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:22.460
I've never done anything to hurt him.
I never even tease him.

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:25.580
It's okay, sweetie.

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:28.240
We don't like it when people judge us,

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.770
especially when they don't even know
who we really are, right?

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:37.850
Phana only said that

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:42.960
because he doesn't know
what kind of person you are yet.

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:49.190
Once he learns that you're actually a very gentle and kind person,

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:53.530
I'm sure he will want to be your friend again.

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:57.100
Then what should I do, Mom?

00:38:57.810 --> 00:39:01.760
You have to open your heart.
Don't close yourself off.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:07.060
You have to let other people see
who you really are.

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:10.180
You know, humans and merfolk...

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:13.410
we're not so different from each other.

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:17.590
We all have feelings, and we all have hearts.

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:20.060
If our hearts can connect with one another,

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:23.560
then even a love that seems impossible

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.950
can become possible.

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:28.130
Really?

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:30.030
Of course, sweetie.

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:32.900
You just have to let your heart lead the way.

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:36.830
Hmm?

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.670
Is what you said really true, Mom?

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.800
I still can't see it.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.120
About what Den told us earlier...

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:13.200
the rumor about humans
coming here to hunt merfolk...

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.110
my father said it's true.

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:18.510
He has already taken care of those people,

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:21.150
but we still can't let our guard down.

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:24.020
Wherever you go, you need to be careful.

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:26.270
I'm worried about you, Nava.

00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:31.200
I understand, Phraphai.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.050
I'll be more careful from now on.

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:06.650
The last time I went to shed my toxins,

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:08.676
I overheard some of the others talking.

00:42:08.676 --> 00:42:12.280
They said a few of our kind have gone missing.

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.540
About two or three of them,

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.454
sometime last week.

00:42:16.454 --> 00:42:21.184
And you two haven't heard anything about this?

I've been pursuing you for almost a month now.
[Next Episode]

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:16.000
Why won't you give me a chance yet?

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.760
Are you giving up already?

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.620
I brought something for you.

00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:21.720
A mermaid keychain.

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:26.560
I saw how cute it was
and it made me think of you.

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:29.696
You're aware that Phraphai
is pursuing your brother, right?

00:43:29.696 --> 00:43:32.480
If there's anyone who deserves to be with Nava,

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.040
that person should be Phraphai.

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.440
He's the perfect match.

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:38.750
If this were actually around your neck, Nava,

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:40.990
I'm sure it would be beautiful.

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:42.660
Nava.

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:46.250
There's something I need to tell you.

00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:55.350
Phana.

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:01.840
You're the first person
who's ever made me feel this way.

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:03.840
Do you know something?

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:09.540
I think I might like you more than I can even handle.

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:30.790
♫ And the sea that seems so vast ♫

00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:32.700
♫ I just watch the waves all day ♫

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.510
♫ Knowing we can never meet ♫

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:40.396
♫ Our hearts that beat as one ♫

00:44:40.396 --> 00:44:45.630
♫ But the world will never listen ♫

00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:49.420
♫ We're just parallel lines
waiting for a miracle ♫

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:56.820
♫ Though the rules of this world
Forbid us from being one ♫

00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:05.240
♫ This love is about you and me
And no one else ♫

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:09.000
♫ We don't have to tell the world
we're in love ♫

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.690
♫ We don't have to tell anyone
and make it messy ♫

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:16.020
♫ Let you be my world ♫

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:20.230
♫ Let's live in our own new world together ♫

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:23.970
♫ We don't have to tell the world
we're together ♫

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:28.640
♫ Because none of that matters at all ♫

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.740
♫ As long as our hearts are one ♫

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:32.650
♫ As long as you are with me ♫

00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:34.970
♫ As long as we love each other ♫

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:40.020
♫ We don't have to tell anyone ♫
