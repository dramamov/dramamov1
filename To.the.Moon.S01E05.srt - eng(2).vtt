(Sprout Daycare Talent Show)

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.380
You know what this is, right?
A talent show.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.720
Kids who aren't even ten yet...

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.550
are playing drums
and waving fans around.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.290
You know, they put on a talent show
that's on a whole other level.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.160
I was in one of those too.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.360
I was actually cast as the lead.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.060
Cinderella, no less.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.330
I wasn't chosen to be Cinderella
because I was pretty.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.930
I was just really good
at rock-paper-scissors.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.470
I beat Se Young, the prettiest girl
in our class, with paper.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.710
Anyway, since I was a princess,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.580
I was so excited I'd finally get
to wear a gorgeous dress.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.510
But then my mom told me...

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.620
she wasn't going to buy a dress...

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.050
that I'd only wear once
for the show.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.190
So, in the end,

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.590
I got demoted
to playing an oak tree.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.800
And I just stood there blankly
in a dark corner of the stage.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.770
I think that's when it hit me.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.700
I wasn't meant to be the lead
for my whole life.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.170
The very back corner of the stage,
with nowhere else to go.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.280
I felt that would be the only part
I'd ever get to have in life.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.480
But hey, it ended up being helpful.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.880
It's like I learned my place.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.050
- Figuring out where you stand?
- I see.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.950
Thanks for sharing.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.930
Next, I'll tell you guys
a story from when I was 13.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.960
What, another story?

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.930
Aren't you guys going to sleep?

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.030
- No!
- Why not?

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.830
Because it's Sunday night.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.900
If we go to sleep now,
we'll have to go to work.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.970
Don't go to sleep. We can't
let the weekend end this way.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.910
I hate Mondays so much!
Come on, let's talk about anything.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.180
Forget it. I'm going to bed.
Stop fighting it and just sleep.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.620
Don't go. Come back.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.250
Come back!

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.290
- It was when I was eight.
- What?

(Episode 5: Star Quality)

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.200
(Lab Safety Rules)

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.340
I feel like
it's not quite sweet enough.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.840
Is the batter cooked differently?

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.680
Since we can't use the machine,

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.650
I guess we'll have to accept
that the taste will be different.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.620
I know it's a lot of trouble,

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.590
but could we adjust the batter
and do it just one more time?

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.630
Sure, why not?

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.760
It's for the founding anniversary,
so a little trouble is nothing.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.600
How many years was it again?

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.070
It's the 30th anniversary.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.200
Our 30th founding anniversary.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.640
Since it's our 30th anniversary,

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.310
we've also specially invited 30 kids
who love our company's snacks.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.580
- Okay, got it.
- Watch out!

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.790
Oh, no.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.100
No. What do I do? Give it to me.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.960
Oh, gosh.
I'll get something to clean this up.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.330
- Just a second, okay?
- Okay.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.400
Goodness.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.670
Just wait here for a moment.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.740
Darn it.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.180
Who is this?

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.980
Want to have dinner together later?

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.290
I know a famous pork cutlet place
near Namsan.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.420
I'm afraid I can't.
I'm too busy-bee-bop-a-lula.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.790
You said you were busy
yesterday too.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.990
And the day before that.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.030
You're not avoiding me, are you?

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.200
No, of course not.
I love pork cutlet, but...

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.500
Yodelayheehoo.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.100
I really was busy yester...

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.140
Why isn't this working?

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.000
I was really busy yesterday...
You go to Hawaii.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.140
because
we're prepping for the event.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.570
Get ready. Mic check, 1, 2.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.950
I've been patient so far,
but turn off autocomplete and talk.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.180
This stupid autocomplete, seriously.
How do I fix this?

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.220
- Gosh. Yes?
- Da Hae.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.520
Here, at least put this on.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.550
Oh, no, I couldn't...

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.260
Why do you look like that?

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.600
Didn't you just come
from the factory?

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.200
What's with your outfit?

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.470
Well...

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.000
The supervisor accidentally spilled
a container of sauce on me.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.370
I have spare clothes
in the call room,

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.810
so I was going to change later.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.610
Didn't I tell you
that would be a huge pain?

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.050
Doing all of that by hand
is not an easy job.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.450
But the kids invited for tomorrow
are most excited about it.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.650
Dondonchip.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.720
It's a shame
we can't use the machines...

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.790
because it is a limited edition.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.860
- But...
- What?

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.270
Why am I the only one
who has to suffer...

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.600
and take all the heat?

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.540
Who's getting the award tomorrow?

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.510
The Excellent Work Ethic Award.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.640
Who's getting it?

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:12.840
It's you, Ms. Round.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.210
But Da Hee and Jun Seo
are getting it too.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.850
You should be thankful
you are one of the three.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.880
Honestly, I'm only...

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.020
saying this now.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.590
But do you know...

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.190
the world of pain I went through
to get you in there?

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.890
You're not even grateful.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.090
Hold on.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.360
So you don't want the award?
Fine, I'll take you off the list.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.930
No.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.500
What about the delivery company?

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.670
Da Hee is taking care of that.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.310
Da Hee was supposed to? Da Hee?

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.740
Where's Da Hee?

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.040
She's filming a company promo video.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.250
She was chosen as an in-house model.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.250
Right. They're showing that
at the event tomorrow, right?

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.080
Who was the male model again?

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.450
Mr. Ko.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.060
- It's Dr. Ham.
- Right.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.590
Dr. Ham?

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.460
They look good together.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.360
They really do look good together.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.930
It's like they hog
all the good looks.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.100
Tell me about it.

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.270
They look amazing together.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.000
Now I see why they call Da Hee
the princess of Marron.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.270
I can totally see why.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.910
Oh, please. A princess?

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.180
Hold on.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.480
Oh, gosh. Hang on.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.050
Cut!

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.020
Sir. This is a company promo video.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.830
But right now,
your expression is like...

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.500
You look like the chief mourner
at a wake.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.330
You looked so tragic,
I almost bowed in condolence.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.240
- So what am I supposed to do?
- Whatever.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.570
We'll have
a voice-over on the video.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.380
I'll read you the lines,
so match your expression to them.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.550
A place that leads the way
in fun and wholesome food.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:59.850
- The FDA?
- Wrong!

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.950
Marron.
A place of passionate camaraderie.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.920
- The army.
- Marron.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.820
A place my soul longs for.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.490
My bed in my room.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.700
Marron.
Forever Maron. Together with Maron.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.100
I love you, Marron.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.340
Show company pride in your face.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.070
Like you actually love working here.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.310
(Today is Happy Marron Day)

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.480
Like this?

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.790
I guess it's a three-day funeral.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.050
The funeral's not over yet.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.090
What's that now?

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.560
- Hey, Assistant Director!
- Yes.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.560
Why aren't you doing crowd control?

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.370
Why haven't you?

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:50.670
I'm sorry.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.740
Excuse me,
could you please step back?

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.410
- Gosh.
- Hey, you!

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.370
I said to get back!

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.880
I said, get back!

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.150
Madam!

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.650
Madam? Me?

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.090
- Hurry up.
- Get over here.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:17.960
Just a moment.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:24.830
By any chance...

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.370
What? Did he recognize me?

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.370
Ma'am, are they serving pork cutlet
in the company cafeteria today?

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:40.520
- I'm sorry. Excuse me.
- What's with her?

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:42.220
- Darn it.
- What's wrong with her?

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.290
I could just die.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.800
Isn't it hilarious?

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.000
Jung Da Hee, Jung Da Hae.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.300
Our names are practically the same,

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.170
but she's "princess,"
and I'm "madam."

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:05.210
And you know what?
I could even let that slide.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:07.140
But...

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.580
he told me...

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.350
to get out of the way.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.120
He said,
"Madam, get out of the way."

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.520
- Are you laughing?
- No.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:25.290
I told you to put more effort
into your appearance.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.500
Based on what people wear,
you can split them into two groups.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.000
"Gosh, they must be well-off."

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.770
"Gosh, I hope they do better."

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.970
You guys are sometimes...

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:39.980
I bow to Buddha.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.980
That's it. I'm just going to die.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:43.380
It'll be easier.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.280
No more embarrassment if I'm dead.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.220
Now's not the time to die.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.090
It's time for a transformation.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:51.490
What?

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:55.020
Ta-da! Made in Boutique Magal.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.830
I present a brand-new, unworn item,
100 percent silk cotton...

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.090
with the tags on.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.330
I'll lend it to you
as a special favor.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.800
What am I supposed to do with this?

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.530
I heard there was a party tomorrow.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.240
Isn't your team in charge of it?

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.540
Come on. It's hardly a party.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.210
Don't tell me
they're leaving you out.

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:12.440
- Are they icing you out too?
- What?

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.540
You're wearing this tomorrow!
Got it?

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.910
And you're getting an award.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:17.410
It's the perfect day
for a transformation.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.980
What am I, a Power Ranger?
Why would I transform?

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.250
Da Hae. Dr. Ham is...

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:23.750
someone who's...

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.750
always at the top
of the real-time search list.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:26.960
What's that supposed to mean?

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:29.090
He's the man of the hour.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.390
The lead man gets the leading lady.

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:34.000
But looking the way you do now...

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.940
Hey, don't you want a shot
with Dr. Ham?

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:45.940
(Ham Ji Woo)

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:48.110
The cafeteria
has pork cutlets today.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.450
For crying out loud.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.450
What is he, a pork cutlet ambassador
or something?

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:57.750
One second.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.420
I heard you were serving
pork cutlets today.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.990
- Who told you that?
- I'm sure someone said so earlier.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.960
Pork cutlets are great and all,

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.700
but if we're seen eating together
at the cafeteria,

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.000
wouldn't that look a little weird?

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.940
People might get the wrong idea.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:18.410
The wrong idea about what?

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.280
No one's going to think
anything of it.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:24.710
(Jung Da Hae: F...)

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.850
What's this?

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.250
Goodness, my autocomplete
is acting up again.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.420
Anyway, I already had lunch.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:33.520
Bye.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:35.620
This...

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:37.630
seems pretty intentional.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:41.160
It's just tteokgalbi.
Would you want one?

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:43.370
No, I'm fine.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.040
Thank you. Have a good one.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.580
Oh, Hee Jung!

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.750
(Hwang Hee Jung)

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.320
Why are you taking...

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.520
Are you quitting?

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:04.050
Yes.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:06.020
It just happened so.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.720
So you didn't renew your contract?

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.090
It's not that I didn't. I couldn't.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.160
You know how it is.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.400
Oh, right.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:19.440
You're leaving with no party?
Why are you all alone?

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:25.210
They didn't even add me
to the O.O group chat.

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.980
Do you really think they'd throw me
a farewell dinner?

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.580
I'm not even holding my breath.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.980
Our team did a great job
wrapping up accounts,

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.650
and we passed the audit flawlessly,

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.150
so the company gave us a bonus.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:44.330
You've all worked really hard,
so treat yourselves to a nice meal.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:47.230
- Thank you.
- Let's not have pork anymore.

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.630
Should we try somewhere new
this time?

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.270
Okay, if you all have a place
you'd like to eat,

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:55.070
post suggestions in the chat.
I'll put together a list.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.470
Oh, gosh.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.410
- We could get some nice beef...
- We could have that.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.680
Can we really get beef?

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.510
(30th Anniversary Event
Seating Chart)

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:06.880
All right!

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.220
What's the key to tomorrow's event?

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.250
It's...

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:12.220
the seating chart.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:16.530
Most important is Table One,
known as the Marron VIP table.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:20.500
Our top executives will be here,
so all eyes will be on this table.

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:23.330
Who should be
the stars of this table?

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:24.700
Let's hear some ideas.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:29.170
Then we need someone who has
common ground with them, right?

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.870
For the record,

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.710
the senior managing director and I
went to the same high school.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.410
I went to the same university.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.110
But you were at
a satellite campus, Ji Won.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.920
- We had the same president.
- Sure.

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:41.580
I served with him in the army.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:42.650
He was exempt from military service.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.950
Or at least,
that's what I wish I could say.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.220
Does everyone really want Table One?

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:49.490
Why?

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:52.260
You'd be sharing a table with him.
Isn't that a little intimidating?

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.100
I'm fine with sitting anywhere.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.930
What? Why would you say that?

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.400
- Dr. Ham will be at Table One too.
- Dr. Ham.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.310
There's an unofficial team legend
about Table One.

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:06.280
If you sit there,
you get promoted in a year.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.780
Not that you're interested,
of course.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:08.880
"Of course?"

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.750
I'll have you know
I'm quite ambitious myself.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.280
Really? My mistake.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:16.390
- Anyway, for tomorrow...
- Hey.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.290
Who has the Milk Tarte
performance report?

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:23.390
I have it,
but do you need it right now?

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.190
- You're not going to give it to me?
- I'll get it right away, sir.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:26.460
Hurry up!

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.200
Ms. Round.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.070
You still haven't changed
out of that?

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:31.670
Go change now!

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.200
This is a workplace,
not a playground.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.870
I just changed into this.

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.240
The color is pretty similar to
the hygiene suit from earlier.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:39.780
How is this even remotely similar?

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.880
Don't get mad.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.410
It's a big day, so I'm being honest.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.650
Besides, like you said yourself,
it's an intimidating table,

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:49.350
so you really have to be dressed
to the nines for it, you know?

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:50.550
So...

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:54.520
what you're saying is that
I don't belong at a table like that.

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:58.460
I'm just saying
that's how important the table is.

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.260
That's strange.

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:05.030
All this time,
I thought I knew where I belonged,

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.000
but right now, I'm starting
to have second thoughts.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.440
Forget "knowing my place."

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.510
Got it?

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.950
Nope, I don't get it.
Let's just be fair about this.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.510
- What?
- I'm sorry,

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:21.550
but I'm starting to want
that important seat too.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.620
So, what can we do?

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.050
There's only one way to settle this.

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:27.420
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.960

Actually, no.
I'll just buy it off you.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:34.820
But I'll need your help.

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.060

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:08.680
Where should I put down the bedding?

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.910
Should I put it here? Or over there?

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.420
- I'm picky about where I sleep.
- Don't be ridiculous.

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:15.880
- I'll put it down here.
- Okay.

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:44.110
I'm your own personal cover artist

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:49.520
Any song you want to hear

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:53.160
From ballads to nursery rhymes

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.560
What am I doing here
with this pain in my neck?

00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:02.960
- I'm your one and only folk singer
- I can't kill him, can I?

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:12.370
From romantic guitar ballads
to all your dreams...

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:14.810
What's wrong?

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:20.250
Are you playing a funeral dirge?
What's with you all of a sudden?

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.250
- Ju Man.
- What?

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.250
I'm kind of talking to this girl,

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:28.920
but she won't grab a meal with me.
What am I supposed to make of that?

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:31.490
Then I'd say you two
aren't really a thing.

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:32.590
What if I want to be a thing
with her?

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:33.830
You have to get a meal together.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.260
- And if she won't grab a meal?
- Then it's not a thing.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.500
- If I want to be a thing with her?
- I think we could do this all day.

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:40.840
- And if she won't grab a meal?
- You little...

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.470
Let's drop it.
I'm just not feeling it.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.110
Fine, let's drop it.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:53.320
Forget making a comeback
and just be happy as the kids' president.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.750
Your Kids' YouTube views are insane.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.850
Look at this!
You have 3.1 million views.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.690
Gosh, Ji Woo-tube!

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:07.230
As long as you keep treating me
to expensive tuna, we're good.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.630
Are you messing with me right now?

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:12.000
Messing with you? You punk.
You started it.

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:15.940
Hey, do you have any idea
how many jobs I need just for rent?

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.640
Even wasting time with you like this
is a luxury I can't afford.

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:20.910
Hey, don't be so dramatic.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.210
- But how do I make it a thing?
- Get out.

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:26.680
- What?
- Are you not leaving?

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.850
- I'm leaving.
- Leave, you jerk.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.420
Leave, you jerk. Get lost.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.290
Get out of here, you punk!

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:36.790
Ji Song, do you know a good place?

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.030
We might finally go somewhere trendy
thanks to you, Ji Song.

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:41.460
Our team hasn't gone out together
in a while.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.230
"Our team?"

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:44.600
(Marron Accounting Team)

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.170
Go wash your face,
and take off that dress already.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:51.770
- I'm just enjoying the moment.
- Enjoying what?

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:56.210
It feels like a magic spell
that'll break at midnight.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:01.280
Eun Sang, I honestly feel like
I'm becoming Cinderella.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.290
Not quite.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.150
Cinderella's magic ends at midnight,

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:08.760
but for us,
when the clock strikes midnight...

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:13.090
Ta-da! It went up again.
Another 50 dollars.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.060
That's amazing.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.530
No more crypto talk.
I hate it, so please stop.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.800
But you're on your phone.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.040
Eun Sang.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:25.670
Do you really think
Ji Song won't invest with us?

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:27.980
But the market's so hot right now.

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:29.940
We'll have to see.

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:32.150
But you won't just "wait and see,"
will you?

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.820
Of course not.
I'm going to break her.

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:39.620
I'll make her do it, no matter what.
That crazy brat.

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:42.190
You're like her mother.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:44.690
Did you give birth to her?

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.930
I did.

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:50.030
What?

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.970
If I'd had her,
she'd be much better.

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:54.040
Imagine if she took after me.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.870
She'd be a judge or prosecutor.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:57.170
Would she end up as
just Kim Ji Song?

00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:59.170
No talking trash about me
to my face.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.340
Gosh, sharp ears on that one.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:04.280
(Ham Ji Woo)

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.310
Excuse me.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:10.420
Can you get off the phone already?

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:11.920
What do you have so much
to talk about?

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:13.490
Just a second.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.990
Our team is in the middle of
a very important conversation.

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.390
"Your team?"

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:20.930
(Marron Accounting Team)

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:22.800
(Our team hasn't gone out together
in a while.)

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.100
Trendy places?
I know all the best spots.

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:27.640
For steak,
try Ristera in Seongsu-dong.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.110
One bite is like a taste
out of this world.

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:33.340
Lion in Hannam-dong has great risotto
made by an Italian chef.

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.910
Ello Kitchen in Yeonnam-dong...

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.750
Ello Kitchen? The one
with a six-month waiting list?

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:39.280
I can never get one either.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:42.250
You want to go there?
We can make it happen.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:45.590
What are you talking about?
They're totally booked for tomorrow.

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.720
Ji Song.
You're not just bluffing, are you?

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.690
This team dinner
is still a work function.

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:53.260
(Marron Accounting Team)

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.900
No, I didn't.
I go there all the time.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:59.230
You're a regular?
So you can call and get us a table?

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:00.340
No way.

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:03.270
Then I guess our regular, Ji Song,
can book the place for our dinner.

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:05.610
Good! Thanks, Ji Song.

00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:10.850
Are you some kind of punk?

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.010
Excuse me?

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.150
You are a punk, aren't you?
Unless you're a punk,

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.350
there's no way you could
make someone feel this pathetic.

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.790
But you're getting the wrong idea.

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:21.360
Just because
I'm always reaching out,

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.560
asking you out for a meal,

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.730
I think you're misreading
this whole situation.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.800
I was just being polite. That's all.
I mean, you know how it is.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.060
After what happened between us,

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:32.630
if we avoid each other,
it will hurt.

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:36.400
So I was just trying to be friendly,
but then you avoid me like this...

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:38.440
Oh, you're breaking up.
Are you driving?

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:43.550
Yes. Look, if you're free,
let's meet up.

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:45.280
We need to clear this up.

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:47.820
Besides, I'm near your place anyway.

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:50.390
Near my place, where?
Are you in Sillim?

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:53.420
Right, Sillim.
Yes, I'm right around there.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.760
Oh, there I go again.
I moved to Daebang-dong.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.360
(Daebang)

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:01.330
Right, Daebang-dong.
I'm right near the station there.

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:03.470
The closest station
is actually Singil Station.

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:05.970
Right, Singil.
That's exactly where I am.

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:10.440
Not sure where you are,
but I happen to be with my friends.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.370
Right, friends. Friends...

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:15.040
Friends?
What are you, an idol group?

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.450
You all live together?
Why are you hanging out so late?

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.710
Anyway, let's meet tomorrow.

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:22.850
I was planning to sit next to you
at the event tomorrow.

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:27.660
We can have a meal together,
and if the CEO's speech drags on,

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.120
we can trash-talk him a bit.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:32.990
You don't like the sound of that?

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.870
Oh, you were
just asking to be polite.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.240
I guess I just didn't get the hint.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.440
I thought you couldn't hear me.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.810
Well, I don't know
my schedule for tomorrow.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:49.080
I'll need time to think about it.

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.380
Of course.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.910
Then take your time and tell...

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.650
All right. Let's do it.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.150
You thought about it
for all of five seconds.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.150
My apologies.
I kept you waiting for so long.

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:02.160
So tomorrow,

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.990
we're definitely meeting.

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:05.960
And you'd better sit next to me.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.100
Okay, see you tomorrow.

He was supposed to be on a trip,

- What?

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:02.440
This is an Italian restaurant.

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.210
She's Italian.

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:10.180
So, you see, she was adopted
and brought to Korea.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:12.980
Buongiorno.

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:16.480
Tiamo. Grazie. Knock it off, eh?

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:17.550
Knock it off, eh?

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:19.390
Knock it off, eh?

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.660
Grazie.

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:23.190
- Could you please come back later?
- Sir.

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:27.730
Do you really want me to throw
a massive pity party right here?

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:32.370
I'd make a scene and embarrass you,
and people would start recording us.

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:34.340
And then post it all over YouTube.

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:36.340
Look.

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:39.940
I don't want to make you
a viral sensation.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:43.140
Mom, I'm so sorry.

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:47.280
I'm telling you,
we are completely booked, ma'am.

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:49.520
Sir.

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:51.820
The seven o'clock party
just canceled.

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:55.220
Kim Ji Song!
Reservation for 6 at 7 p.m. tonight.

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.230
Wait, but you just said it was
for you and your mother.

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:01.200
Hey, I made the reservation.
No take-backs.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.260
And also,
if it's not too much trouble,

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:06.600
could you please pretend
we're close?

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:09.400
Like I come here
about five times a week...

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.070
and order the priciest tasting menu
like it's nothing.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:15.780
You know, like I'm one
of your elegant regulars.

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:17.550
Excuse me?

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:19.650
Mamma mia! She's insane.

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:24.050
Thank you.

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:27.160
Okay, reservation's set.

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.320
Hey, we've got some time to kill.
Let's go to the department store.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.490
Why the department store?

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:32.960
Didn't you see the decor in there?

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:35.230
I've got to splurge
to match the vibe.

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:38.530
Gosh, you lied about my nationality,
and now you're excited?

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:41.400
Why lie about being a regular
of an expensive restaurant...

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.570
in the first place?

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.240
Well, it's because...

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:46.940
- the group chat...
- What do you possibly gain...

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:48.810
from lying just to show off?

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:50.810
What I gain?

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.350
Photos.

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:56.320
They're great for my social media.
And since we're coworkers,

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:59.890
I thought we could get
a nice picture together as a team.

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:05.890
A photo you post on social media,
all dolled up at a fancy place.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:07.560
Do you really think
that's your life?

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.260
Real life is...

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:13.530
what happens outside
of that photo, Ji Song.

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:16.740
Gosh, what's your point?

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:18.970
My point is,
let's stop pretending...

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:22.110
and start living an authentic life.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:25.280
- Why don't we do crypto...
- Don't you dare bring up crypto.

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:27.920
I'm not listening. I don't want to!

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:31.020
- No!
- Crypto!

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:33.250
- Stop it!
- That kid, I swear.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:40.460
But why haven't I heard from her?
I hope she's doing all right.

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.260
Gosh.

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.100
(Baking happiness
into everyone's daily lives)

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:46.170
Marron Confectionery.

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:48.500
Forever, Marron! Together, Marron!

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:49.970
We love you, Marron!

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.170
(Marron Confectionery)

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.240
We love you!

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.480
- Marron!
- Marron!

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:02.250
Gosh, Dr. Ham,
you're a natural on camera.

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.290
- Thanks.
- Goodness.

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:07.520
I was told I looked like an actor
back in the day.

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:09.920
You know Leslie Cheung?

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:14.000
They called me the Leslie Cheung
of Gaepo-dong.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.400
Way to disrespect the dead.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.670
This table looks a little different
from the others.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.170
There are flowers,

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.170
and there's a cushion just for me?

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.180
You're right. It's almost as if
someone prepared it.

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:33.250
Everyone, have you seen the movie,
"Days of Being Wild?"

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.120
There's a scene
where Leslie Cheung...

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:38.790
Is there anyone who can survive
without our products?

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:42.560
Where are you sitting?
I'm with Gaepo-dong's Leslie Cheung.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.390
Did you just raise your hand
over there?

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:46.790
Da Hae?

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:49.300
Oh, hi.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.830
This seat is empty, right?

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.230
Yes.

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:57.840
Weren't you supposed to sit
at Table One tonight?

00:32:58.170 --> 00:32:59.570
Why did the CEO...

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:01.910
It's just how it worked out.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.910
But you should be sitting up front.
Why are you back here?

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:09.020
Because I wanted to sit with you.

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:14.190
I really want to get closer to you.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:15.790
Oh...

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:20.190
Sure, it'd be nice
to be friends, but...

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:23.970
Perfect. We can go up together
to get our award later, right?

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:25.370
Oh, right, the award.

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.300
Sure, let's go up together.

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:33.270
Next, to recognize the hard work
of all our employees,

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:34.780
we'll begin the awards presentation.

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:35.780
It's starting.

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.910
I'll announce the recipients
right away.

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.780
Winners are Ms. Jung Da Hee,
Mr. Yoon Jun Seo,

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:43.020
and Ms. Jung Da Hae
from the Marketing Team.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.020
Due to time constraints,

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:47.660
Ms. Jung Da Hee
will accept the award for the team.

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:49.020
Ms. Jung Da Hee.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:50.930
Jung Da Hee!

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:52.460
Nice.

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:54.830
Please come up to the stage.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.230
Oh, well, it's...

00:33:58.030 --> 00:33:59.130
What are you doing?

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:01.440
Go on.
They're calling for you, Da Hee.

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:04.870
- We love you, Jung Da Hee!
- We love you, Jung Da Hee!

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:07.440
- Picture-perfect Jung Da Hee!
- Picture-perfect Jung Da Hee!

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.710
Marketing Team!

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:12.380
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:16.550
Fourteenth Class!

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:17.890
- Fourteenth Class!
- Fourteenth Class!

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:19.420
- Fourteenth Class!
- Fourteenth Class!

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:23.120
- Fourteenth Class!
- Fourteenth Class!

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.560
What a heartwarming moment
with her colleagues' zealous support.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.530
Please come join me on stage
right here.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.100
And now, for the award presentation.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.800
(Excellent Work Ethic Award,
Jung Da Hee and 2 others)

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.840
"The Excellent Work Ethic Award,
Jung Da Hee and two others."

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:43.780
"For your diligent work ethic
and responsibility in your duties,"

00:34:43.910 --> 00:34:45.950
"you have been a shining example
to your colleagues."

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.850
"In recognition
of your contributions,"

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:50.820
"we are pleased
to present this award."

00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.430
I thought we were all supposed to
accept this together.

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:06.530
I'm so happy to receive this award
on such a meaningful day.

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:10.600
I'd especially like to thank
everyone for their generous...

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:12.140
Oh, gosh.

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:32.790
My dress.

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:58.350
What are you doing?
Why did you come in here?

00:35:58.350 --> 00:35:59.750
Because you didn't answer my texts.

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:01.120
Because I didn't answer?

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:05.490
- Go on, get out of here.
- What's wrong? Are you avoiding me?

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:06.960
You won't even look at me.

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:10.630
No, it's not that.
It's just a complicated situation.

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.330
So what is
this "complicated situation?"

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:14.100
Come on, seriously.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.870
What's wrong with your face?

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:19.310
Gosh. My nose just started bleeding.

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:21.910
Seriously.

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:23.610
Serves you right.

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:25.710
What?

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:29.150
I'm just saying,

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:31.650
you did me wrong.

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.390
So now you're being punished.

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:49.740
What did I do that was so wrong?

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:51.410
You don't think it was?

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.280
Toying with someone's emotions
like that?

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:56.410
What are you talking about?

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:57.510
But it's true.

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:01.080
You have me tied up in knots.

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:04.390
Can't you tell
just by looking at me?

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:17.430
Unbelievable. Is he for real?

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:20.470
Playing with my heart like this?

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.640
Did you guys see Da Hee
sitting at the CEO's table?

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:27.780
- I'm so jealous.
- Tell me about it.

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:31.110
- Whatever. Let's just chill here.
- Sounds good.

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:33.050
- This is uncomfortable.
- Isn't this Da Hae's seat?

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:34.980
Where did she go?
She was originally at Table One.

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:37.080
She switched earlier.
I saw her go somewhere else.

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.390
But hey, did you guys see
Da Hae today?

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:42.260
She came all dolled up, didn't she?

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:45.960
Seeing her sitting there with Da Hee
was kind of funny, you know?

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:48.000
Da Hae was in that white dress...

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:50.500
and sitting next to Da Hee.
She was kind of like...

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.370
the shredded radish they put
under sashimi.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.500
- What? Like hors d'oeuvre?
- Ji Won, "hors d'oeuvre?"

00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:59.040
A side dish. Let's stick to English.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:00.910
Right.

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.410
What was that?
Did you see that move?

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:05.850
Yes, something definitely moved.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.310
Gosh, that scared me!

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:08.750
What is this?

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:11.250
- Gosh!
- What?

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:12.250
What?

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:14.050
- Is someone in there?
- Someone's in there?

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.960
- Someone's in there?
- Lift the table.

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:20.960
That...

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:23.830
- What now?
- Just turn.

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:25.570
- Turn? What do you mean, turn?
- What's happening?

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:26.900
- Turn now.
- Gosh.

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:28.940
You're making my head spin.
What do I do?

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:30.500
- Go straight!
- Straight?

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:33.170
- What's that?
- What's that?

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:34.610
What do I do? Where do I go?

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:37.180
- Turn left.
- Left? Turn left.

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:38.710
Do I keep going?

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:42.320
- Get out of the way!
- Hold on.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.820
Stop!

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.530
I hit something.
I think it was a person.

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.190
Where's the door?

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:55.530
There it is! I see light!
It's over there!

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:56.600
- Run!
- Run!

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:00.630
Wait, what's that? Get down!

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.240
Get down!

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.740
Down again!

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.720
- Where do we go?
- Over there. The emergency exit!

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:24.660
The emergency exit!

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.330
- Da Hae, we're almost there!
- Darn it.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.370
We just have to get past this.
Hang in there.

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.770
Gosh, he and I
have terrible teamwork.

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:34.840
Ms. Round?

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.540
What? Mr. Ko.

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:38.910
What do you think you're doing here,
Ms. Round?

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:40.640
It's kind of a long story.

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.480
Why aren't you answering
Mr. Kim's calls from the factory?

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:44.550
He said he's called you
over 20 times.

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:46.150
What?

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:49.050
I didn't get any calls.

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:51.450
- But what's the problem?
- "What's the problem?"

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:55.060
A hundred boxes were misdelivered.
That's "the problem."

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.320
What address did you give
to the delivery company?

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.390
Sorry?

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.430
Da Hee was the one who contacted
the delivery company...

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:02.500
Da Hee is one of the award winners.

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.600
She's busy schmoozing with the CEO.

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.330
Of course, you're doing a great job.

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:08.770
I travel so much for work, so...

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:11.070
(Hajin Delivery, Missed Call,
21 More Notifications)

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:14.880
Shouldn't you have handled it,
Ms. Round?

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:18.680
The kids and their guardians
are here. What will you do about it?

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:19.750
I'm also...

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:21.380
The award...

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.520
Seriously.

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:25.350
I'm sorry.

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:27.220
Unbelievable.

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:29.920
How do we fix this?

00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:36.800
Our next award is
for the Achievement Award.

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.100
Hey.

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:46.770
Are you okay?

00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:51.310
I guess.

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.650
Aside from being
a little embarrassed, I'm okay.

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:55.480
It's actually kind of funny.

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.290
I mean, I just totally got
humiliated, right?

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:02.920
It's not that funny.

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:06.690
Why not? It is!

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:09.900
I think it's funny.

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:15.440
That's right.

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.210
To be honest,
I don't think it's funny either.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.240
Can't I...

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:22.210
just laugh it off?

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:28.120
You don't think I got all dolled up
in this fancy dress...

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:30.120
just to be humiliated like this,
do you?

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:33.320
I was hoping for my own big moment,
you know?

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:36.860
But it turns out
that was just me being greedy,

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:40.990
and that everyone could see
right through me.

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:43.760
Seriously,

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:46.870
I'm so embarrassed
that I could just die.

00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:52.370
So I'm just trying to laugh it off,
but you can't take a hint, can you?

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:53.840
What were you hoping for?

00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:56.240
Sorry?

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:57.910
You said you were waiting
for your big moment.

00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:59.810
What was it supposed to be?

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:03.250
Did you...

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:06.650
want to be the star of the ceremony
or something?

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:09.390
Looks like I hit the nail
on the head.

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:11.190
Now that's a little funny.

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:15.630
- What are you talking...
- I think you're totally wrong.

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:18.430
I mean, think about it.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:22.240
Does wearing a fancy dress
make you the star?

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.670
You have to do something amazing
to be the star.

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.540
But when it comes down to it,

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:29.040
you haven't done anything yet,
have you?

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:31.080
So what's there to be
embarrassed about?

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:33.050
What can I...

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.150
- possibly do?
- Anything.

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:41.720
- You pick a fight so easily.
- I'm done trying harder!

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.990
You're the type to flip a table
and run for it if you had to.

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:48.030
- Lift the table.
- What?

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:51.470
You can do anything
you set your mind to.

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:53.300
The way I see it,

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.540
you're the type who can turn
any place into your own stage.

00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:00.040
At that moment, it hit me.

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:03.940
Sweetie, over here!

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.150
Right here!

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.050
Da Hae.

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:15.920
Mom! When did you get here?

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.790
- Did you see me?
- Of course I did.

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:20.090
How'd you even see me?

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.260
I was all the way
in the corner of the stage.

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:25.330
All I could see was my daughter.

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:28.740
You're always the brightest star,
wherever you are.

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:30.140
- Really?
- Yes.

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:33.640
Actually,
I wasn't just standing there.

00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:35.080
I was doing a bit of acting.

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.940
A branch, trembling in the wind.

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:38.380
Do you want to see?

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:41.580
Shiver! What do you think?
I'm pretty good, right?

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:42.720
You're the best!

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:47.220
No matter where I am,

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:49.990
no matter what I wear,
I can be magnificent.

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:53.060
I'm someone who can't be
defined by a mere dress.

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.800
Someone who can do
absolutely anything.

00:43:55.930 --> 00:43:59.970
Even earlier, I thought we were
doing a lion mask dance.

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:03.340
Seriously, our performance was
Intangible Cultural Heritage-level.

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:05.670
- The restaurant.
- What?

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:08.340
- Where's the restaurant?
- It's on B1.

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:12.880
Please help me.

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:14.380
I'm ready to do whatever it takes.

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:16.620
Please stop by.

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:20.050
It hurts.

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:22.360
Hey kids, that hurts. Stop it.

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:27.130
- Hello?
- Do one part-time job for me.

00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:30.430
Yes, that's my dream.
To only have one part-time job.

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:32.500
I have to go wait tables now.

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:36.240
I wonder when I'll ever be able
to realize my musical vision.

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.770
That vision? This kids' president
will make it happen for you.

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:44.340
- Get over here.
- What?

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:46.610
(Enderion)

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:47.780
You want us not to tell Ji Song...

00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:49.520
we moved the restaurant
for our team dinner?

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:51.950
It's her regular spot anyway.

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:53.320
We can go with her another time.

00:44:55.890 --> 00:44:57.360
But still,
that seems a little harsh.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.930
She tried hard
to get that reservation...

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:02.300
since we all wanted to go there.

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.430
And she seemed genuinely happy
to be invited to the group chat.

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:07.000
Can you get off the phone already?

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.440
What do you have so much
to talk about?

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.870
Just a second.

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:13.540
Our team is in the middle of
a very important conversation.

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:17.880
She's always posting memes in chat
and never misses a chance to say hi.

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:21.110
She's just walking on eggshells.
She knows she's the odd one out.

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.680
She knows she doesn't fit in.

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:25.450
I don't get why
we added Kim Ji Song...

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:27.520
to the group chat
in the first place.

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:30.720
We only got the team incentive
because of our hard work, right?

00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:33.430
She's just an office operator.
As if she did anything.

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:35.260
You've got a point there.

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:50.810
What do you think you're doing?

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:53.280
My bad.

00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:57.780
- Darn it.
- Oh, no.

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:02.290
Kang Eun Sang, you're so pathetic.

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:03.890
When you didn't even know anything,

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:06.390
you went and lectured her
like you knew better.

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.300
Gosh, why isn't she picking up?

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:20.370
Wei Lin! Guess where I am right now?

00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:21.980
Ta-da!

00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:24.880
I'm at my team dinner!

00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:28.520
Lucky you, honey.
That place is gorgeous.

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:31.720
But not as pretty as you, Ji Song.

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:33.020
Beautiful!

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:34.320
Hang on a second!

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:36.520
(Eun Sang)

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:37.660
(Can I call you back later?)

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:42.430
Honey, we should come here together
when you're in Korea.

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:44.460
This place is so beautiful.

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:51.570
All right, kids!

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.270
I am so sorry.

00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:58.280
The gift we were so excited
to give you,

00:46:58.350 --> 00:47:01.180
Dondonchip, the pork cutlet flavor.

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:03.920
Unfortunately, because of
a problem on our end,

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:05.450
we can't...

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:07.850
give them out today.

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:16.160
- Snacks!
- But we...

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.260
Hold on!

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:19.630
(30th Anniversary Celebration
Snack Giveaway for Kids)

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:43.290
Isn't that Dr. Ham?

00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:45.160
That's Dr. Ham.

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.190
Dr. Ham, what's going on?

00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:48.900
The microphone, please.

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:51.030
What's with the guitar?

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:55.840
An impromptu showcase
for a brief break.

00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:14.220
Flying over Mount Everest's peak

00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:17.060
Zooming on past the stratosphere

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:20.060
Life is a war, but who cares?

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:23.030
I'm flying through the starlight

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:25.630
So sick of the same old boring day

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:28.700
Surrounded by all these tense people

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:30.000
I just go and change the channel

00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:31.470
They keep on talking

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:35.580
But I'm not interested
in that at all

00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:40.410
That one place
shining ever so bright

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:44.890
That's what really catches my eye

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:49.920
Going round and round

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.490
The Earth keeps on spinning

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:56.260
- When I'm going round
- What? Dr. Ham is singing?

00:48:56.330 --> 00:48:57.700
He's actually pretty good.

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:01.270
I think my kid listens to this song
on YouTube.

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:02.870
That's right. So does my nephew.

00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:04.100
- Right?
- Yes.

00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:06.610
- This song was in my algorithm too.
- Really?

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:10.210
Gosh, the kids really love this.
They're all singing along.

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:13.950
- Round and round
- Round and round

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:20.090
- Spinning round and round
- Spinning round and round

00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:25.090
- Round and round
- Round and round

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:31.530
- Spinning round and round
- Spinning round and round

00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:35.940
- He's so good!
- Bravo!

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:37.000
That's awesome!

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:40.470
Dr. Ham, you're the best!

00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:45.250
One more song!
Come on, sing another one!

00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:55.360
Gosh.

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:05.770
If the pork cutlet snacks won't do,
we'll have to serve the real thing.

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:09.670
Thirty pork cutlet specials,
coming through!

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:16.380
That looks delicious.

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:24.280
You're amazing!
How did you even think of this?

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:25.850
Is there anything you can't do?

00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:30.090
What a relief.

00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:31.620
Thank you so much, Da Hae.

00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:34.260
If it weren't for you, our team
would've been in huge trouble.

00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:35.860
You saved our necks.

00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:37.800
We just got lucky
with the cafeteria menu.

00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:40.370
They just happened
to be serving pork cutlets.

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:47.340
The side dish was
just excellent today.

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:48.810
Right?

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:55.180
I guess that's the power
of social media.

00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:56.850
I was so surprised.
Did you see them all singing along?

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:59.350
It felt like a Bruno Mars concert.

00:50:59.350 --> 00:51:01.150
The Bruno Mars of preschoolers.

00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:02.920
Ham Ji Woo Mars.

00:51:03.090 --> 00:51:05.290
It kind of sounds Japanese, doesn't it?
Anyway...

00:51:25.810 --> 00:51:26.810
Excuse me, ma'am.

00:51:27.310 --> 00:51:28.980
This is last call.

00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:33.150
Okay.

00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:47.970

00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:51.570

Forget it.

00:52:17.530 --> 00:52:19.030
It's obvious what's happening.

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:21.730
Why even bother asking?

00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:30.110
- All right, let's dig in.
- This looks so good.

00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:31.610
- It smells amazing.
- I'm going to enjoy this.

00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:33.410
Hold on a second.

00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:36.980
Hold on. Ji Song isn't here yet.

00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:40.950
I'll shoot her a quick text.

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:42.390
Wait.

(Marron Yoon Tae Young
has left the chat.)

00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:46.090
What?

00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:50.260
Wait, why did everyone
leave the group chat?

00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:53.170
Oh, that?

00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:55.800
After thinking about it,
since we all have our own lives,

00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:58.170
a group chat seemed unnecessary.

00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:01.140
If it's something important,
we can just text each other.

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:03.480
Wait, but that means
Ji Song has no idea...

00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:07.310
- I'll give her a quick call.
- Wait.

00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:11.420
Ji Song said she was meeting
her boyfriend today.

00:53:11.550 --> 00:53:13.220
Don't call. Read the room.

00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:17.090
Oh, really?

00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:19.660
- Let's just eat without her.
- Okay.

00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:21.260
- Should we make a toast?
- Yes.

00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:22.800
All right, cheers!

00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:24.400
- Cheers.
- Mr. Oh, you too.

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:26.700
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

Ji Song.

00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:50.390
Eun Sang?

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:51.790
Gosh, my knees.

00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:53.630
What are you doing here?

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:55.030
So you've been in here...

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:56.960
eating pasta,

00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:58.800
and pizza,

00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:00.430
drinking wine,

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.440
and getting that perfect shot.

00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:06.440
And while you're probably feeling
full and happy,

00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:10.910
I'm absolutely starving.

00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:14.480
Let's go get a bite to eat. Okay?

00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:19.120
Why? I just ate. I'm stuffed.

00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:23.620
Because I'm hungry.
I'm the one who's starving.

00:54:26.090 --> 00:54:27.660
- What do you want to eat?
- What?

00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:30.660
- I think my knees are shot.
- Oh, come on.

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:33.800
This is exhausting.

00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:46.380
People can rave about
Western food all they want,

00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:48.310
but nothing beats Korean food.

00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:51.020
You got that right.

00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:57.560
Seriously, why are you so obsessed
with these team dinners?

00:54:58.190 --> 00:54:59.930
It's just a meal
with your coworkers.

00:54:59.930 --> 00:55:01.260
What's the big deal?

00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:03.330
Besides, you eat with us
all the time.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.000
Come on.

00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:07.700
You guys aren't my coworkers.

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:09.540
You're my family.

00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:13.370
And it's good to get along...

00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:15.010
with my actual colleagues too,
you know?

00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:17.780
It's not like we have to be
enemies or anything.

00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:20.880
They even invited me to their chat,
so I thought...

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:23.680
they felt the same way.

00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:30.620
She's just walking on eggshells.
She knows she's the odd one out.

00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:31.960
She knows she doesn't fit in.

00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:36.700
You see...

00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:39.430
- "O.O."
- "Oh?"

00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:41.470
They call Ji Song O.O?

00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:46.370
Oh, try some of this stir-fried squid.

00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:47.510
This is delicious, isn't it?

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:50.010
- Okay.
- Eat up.

00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:54.610
Gosh, I had no idea.

00:55:55.210 --> 00:55:56.850
When Da Hae and I were
talking about being off-cycle hires,

00:55:56.850 --> 00:55:58.920
she must have been dying inside.

00:55:59.750 --> 00:56:00.820
So...

00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:03.790
So, O.O...

00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:05.490
O, what?

00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:09.760
Oh, where on your face do you think
you should get work done?

00:56:11.830 --> 00:56:13.600
I'm pretty enough as I am.

00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:18.370
What's up with you?
What is it you're trying to say?

00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:22.410
I'm trying to say, O.O...

00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:26.810
Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market
is seeing a remarkable surge.

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:29.880
Various cryptocurrencies are posting
huge gains day after day,

00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:32.750
grabbing the attention of investors.

00:56:32.850 --> 00:56:35.190
Enderion in particular is surging.

00:56:35.290 --> 00:56:37.060
Let's take a look at today's chart.

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:38.060
(Enderion price trend)

00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:46.200
(Enderion, 800 dollars)

00:56:49.170 --> 00:56:51.170
It's skyrocketing!

00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:58.580
After my first album failed,
I got a job right away.

00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:01.080
I decided to quit music for good.

00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:05.120
I sold my guitar and bought
a pair of dress shoes back then,

00:57:05.850 --> 00:57:07.090
and it felt like...

00:57:07.450 --> 00:57:09.860
I was stepping on a pebble
in those shoes.

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:13.690
It just kept rolling around,
getting under my foot.

00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:16.730
To me, that pebble
was just like my music.

00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:20.430
It was definitely hurting me,

00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:22.970
but I didn't have the guts
to take it out.

00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:26.110
But I also didn't have the guts
to just shake it out of my shoe.

00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:30.110
I walked on
with a pebble in my shoe,

00:57:30.110 --> 00:57:31.480
and that's how I got to where I am.

00:57:34.410 --> 00:57:36.080
That dress of yours...

00:57:37.550 --> 00:57:39.190
is just like these shoes to me.

00:57:40.050 --> 00:57:41.550
They're expensive and nice,

00:57:41.550 --> 00:57:44.590
but wearing them
doesn't make me a star.

00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:48.730
Because I'm still not
where I truly want to be,

00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:51.660
doing what I truly want to do.

00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:00.610
So...

00:58:02.410 --> 00:58:04.580
how expensive were those shoes?
Were they designer?

00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:08.880
Is that all you got from my story?
That the shoes were expensive?

00:58:15.050 --> 00:58:16.120
For me,

00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:17.790
I'd still love...

00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:20.930
to have things like that,
at least once.

00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:24.360
The kind of dress Song Hye Kyo wore.

00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:26.900
The kind of car Jun Ji Hyun drives.

00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:30.670
And the apartment
Kim Tae Hee lives in.

00:58:32.810 --> 00:58:34.540
I get that the real stars are...

00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:36.940
amazing without all that stuff...

00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:38.480
in my head,

00:58:39.310 --> 00:58:41.180
but my heart just isn't there yet.

00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:43.820
You're so materialistic.

00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:45.990
Oh, gosh. Was it that obvious?

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:50.420
I'll have to take you somewhere
really expensive next time.

00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:52.390
There's a next time?

00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:54.960
What, so there's no next time?
What's up with that?

00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:56.360
Are you a punk?

00:58:58.530 --> 00:58:59.600
We should get going now.

00:58:59.670 --> 00:59:01.630
Already?
Come on, let's stay a little longer.

00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:06.170
Hey, listen. Let's at least
grab coffee over there.

00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:08.110
But I'm about to miss my last train.

00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:14.010
But it'll be fine
if you walk me to the station.

00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:19.550
In that case,
I'll run with you to the station.

00:59:19.550 --> 00:59:21.790
I run 100m in 12 seconds.
I'm crazy fast.

00:59:26.090 --> 00:59:28.900
Sometimes you're so great,
but then at times like this...

00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:30.030
But then what?

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:31.460
You're a total bust.

00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:34.300
A bust? What are you talking about?

00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:37.640
Gosh, hold on a second.

00:59:38.970 --> 00:59:39.970
Just a second.

00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:42.680
What's going on?
You've been acting weird.

00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:43.680
Does something hurt?

00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:45.950
No, I think there's something
in my shoe.

00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:49.380
Again? In such expensive shoes.

00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:53.850
I got a call. Shake that out.

00:59:57.290 --> 00:59:58.790
- Hello?
- It's skyrocketing!

00:59:58.790 --> 00:59:59.790
Gosh, you scared me!

00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:02.800
- Da Hae! It's skyrocketing!
- What?

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:05.100
Wait. Just a second. Hang up.

01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:08.770
(Enderion, 800 dollars)

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:11.570
No way!

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:47.610
See? This is why.

01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:49.580
What?

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:52.810
I endured it, fearing you'd run off.

01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:55.310
Because I wanted to keep walking
with you.

01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:57.250
Dr. Ham.

01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:00.990
But why me?

01:01:01.690 --> 01:01:02.890
Why do you think?

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:06.060
Why do you think
I'm acting this way?

01:01:08.890 --> 01:01:09.960
Da Hae.

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:19.410
The pebble from Dr. Ham's shoe...

01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:21.940
must've rolled right into my heart.

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:26.210
Isn't a rolling pebble's sound
supposed to be a clatter?

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:29.520
So why do I keep hearing "thump?"

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:53.540
No. It's because my crypto price
went up.

01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:55.340
It's all because of the crypto.

01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:08.890
(Epilogue)

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:17.730
Do the team members
ever eat together?

01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:20.270
What do you guys usually get?

01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:24.000
Is pork cutlet a bad idea?

01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:29.680
We love pork cutlets.
We all go out for them for lunch.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:30.740
You do?

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.080
Then Namsan
would be the perfect spot.

01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:36.150
But it's probably too far
to go for lunch.

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:40.720
Does someone need to
like pork cutlets?

01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:44.160
Is it...

01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:46.330
Ms. Round?

01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:48.430
Ms. Round?

01:02:48.830 --> 01:02:51.330
Oh, it's Da Hae's nickname.

01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:53.330
It's like a pet name, you know.

01:02:53.330 --> 01:02:56.270
Jung Da Hae's nickname
is "Round?" Why?

01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:00.040
Is it because she's round?
That's hilarious.

01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:04.410
But she doesn't seem
to be the round type.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.710
And neither is her personality.

01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:09.780
And when she gets mad,
she could kill you with a glance.

01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:15.220
That's the kind of look she has.

01:03:16.090 --> 01:03:17.590
But what do I know?

01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:23.300
- What's with him?
- So, any other nicknames?

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:24.930
Hey, that expression is perfect.

01:03:25.330 --> 01:03:27.400
- Hey, get the shot! Quick!
- No, not really.

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:30.140
That expression right there
is pure company loyalty.

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:31.170
But...

01:03:32.170 --> 01:03:34.970
Director, I don't think it's
the company he's in love with.

01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:45.420
(To the Moon)

01:04:04.070 --> 01:04:06.270
(Special thanks to Zhang Hao
for his cameo)

01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:11.240
With the Averages...

01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:13.710
Put your hands up!

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:16.080
We came here to splurge for once.

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:18.150
A little splurge like this
won't hurt once in a while.

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:19.990
- Hey, not bad.
- Get into crypto.

01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:21.690
No more crypto talk,
or I'm going home.

01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:22.760
Hand over your phone.

01:04:22.790 --> 01:04:24.160
I'll just hold onto it
until tonight.

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.690
- Hey, it's not in here.
- What?

01:04:25.690 --> 01:04:27.660
This is exactly why you shouldn't have
collected all our phones!

01:04:27.890 --> 01:04:29.500
What do you think you're doing?

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.160
What if it tanks and we can't check?

01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:32.930
Are you trying
to completely ruin our trip?

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.730
Help me.

01:04:36.070 --> 01:04:37.640
Da Hae!

01:04:40.770 --> 01:04:42.780
