Why don't you hit me?

00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:45.601
Hit me!

00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:46.002
Sorry!

00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:46.482
Hit me!

00:01:46.482 --> 00:01:47.202
It's all my fault.

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:48.081
Go away!

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:49.441
You! Let go of me!

00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:50.721
Why do you control me?

00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:51.601
Let go!

00:01:52.122 --> 00:01:53.042
Let go!

00:01:53.482 --> 00:01:54.361
Let go!

00:01:55.402 --> 00:01:56.762
Let go, you!

00:01:57.081 --> 00:01:57.682
Let go!

00:01:59.282 --> 00:02:00.081
Let go!

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:04.161
Actually, I have one more merit.

00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:05.881
I'm a sincere person,

00:02:06.122 --> 00:02:07.682
especially to relationships.

00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:09.481
If one gives me a favor,

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:11.122
I'll repay him tenfold.

00:02:11.242 --> 00:02:12.282
- Mr. Liang.
- I...

00:02:12.522 --> 00:02:13.641
You really have many merits.

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:15.161
I'm home.

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:16.242
Go to bed early.

00:02:16.282 --> 00:02:16.802
Thank you.

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:17.641
Xu Yan.

00:02:18.641 --> 00:02:19.522
I really enjoy

00:02:19.522 --> 00:02:20.802
spending time alone with you.

00:02:21.522 --> 00:02:23.122
This feeling is unprecedented.

00:02:26.802 --> 00:02:29.641
Yuanhang has many projects,

00:02:30.682 --> 00:02:33.041
yet you still put effort in Yan Studio.

00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:35.321
I really appreciate it.

00:02:35.962 --> 00:02:37.402
So I want to find an opportunity

00:02:37.402 --> 00:02:38.562
to express my gratitude.

00:02:39.402 --> 00:02:40.362
Today,

00:02:40.362 --> 00:02:41.402
I can let you feel relaxed

00:02:41.441 --> 00:02:42.721
despite your busy schedule.

00:02:43.402 --> 00:02:44.362
It makes me happy too.

00:02:47.002 --> 00:02:48.161
In that case,

00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:50.082
we can only talk

00:02:50.082 --> 00:02:51.201
about work in the future?

00:02:51.441 --> 00:02:51.881
Exactly.

00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:04.201
Don't be alert.

00:03:04.842 --> 00:03:06.201
I'm truly single.

00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:09.481
But I'm still married.

00:03:14.962 --> 00:03:16.002
But I think

00:03:16.002 --> 00:03:17.962
there's a huge problem

00:03:18.242 --> 00:03:19.441
between you and Shen Haoming.

00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:21.362
You're aware of this too.

00:03:23.601 --> 00:03:24.641
Between him and me,

00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:26.282
there is indeed a problem to resolve.

00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:27.761
But that doesn't mean

00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:29.562
I can accept another man.

00:03:31.321 --> 00:03:31.842
Mr. Liang.

00:03:33.242 --> 00:03:34.441
Thank you

00:03:34.441 --> 00:03:36.522
for sharing
your cinematic world with me.

00:03:37.321 --> 00:03:38.402
I can tell

00:03:38.402 --> 00:03:41.481
you're someone really romantic,

00:03:43.282 --> 00:03:45.082
and never lonely.

00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:49.122
But in my mind,

00:03:49.282 --> 00:03:50.802
you're an excellent investor.

00:03:52.721 --> 00:03:53.881
I don't want

00:03:54.002 --> 00:03:55.881
any emotional entanglement

00:03:55.881 --> 00:03:57.481
to affect our current

00:03:57.481 --> 00:03:58.962
professional partnership.

00:03:59.282 --> 00:04:00.002
What do you think?

00:04:00.842 --> 00:04:01.562
I understand.

00:04:03.002 --> 00:04:04.962
If a woman rejects a man,

00:04:05.682 --> 00:04:07.402
it means the man
hasn't done well enough.

00:04:08.721 --> 00:04:09.601
I'll take your advice.

00:04:11.402 --> 00:04:12.881
I'll focus on being the investor.

00:04:14.242 --> 00:04:15.041
I believe

00:04:15.962 --> 00:04:18.562
the trust and mutual understanding
built in business

00:04:19.201 --> 00:04:20.722
will foster more genuine feelings.

00:04:21.362 --> 00:04:21.802
Alright.

00:04:22.162 --> 00:04:22.641
Bye then.

00:04:23.682 --> 00:04:24.201
Yan.

00:04:33.002 --> 00:04:34.122
Why do you come back alone?

00:04:34.722 --> 00:04:35.641
You should've told me,

00:04:36.081 --> 00:04:37.042
and I would pick you up.

00:04:38.521 --> 00:04:39.362
I brought her home.

00:04:43.242 --> 00:04:44.042
Thank you.

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:46.521
After working hard,

00:04:46.682 --> 00:04:48.961
you still help me send my wife home.

00:04:49.321 --> 00:04:50.002
It's okay.

00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:52.881
Ms. Xu has moved out.

00:04:53.521 --> 00:04:55.722
Now you have to shuttle between places.

00:04:56.482 --> 00:04:57.521
She's that kind of person.

00:04:58.401 --> 00:04:59.881
Once she makes up her mind,

00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:02.081
she'll be devoted to it.

00:05:03.162 --> 00:05:03.841
It's late now.

00:05:04.441 --> 00:05:06.401
I won't invite you to my home then.

00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:06.961
No need.

00:05:07.441 --> 00:05:09.242
Ms. Xu and I will meet again tomorrow.

00:05:09.441 --> 00:05:11.281
You know, collaboration.

00:05:11.602 --> 00:05:12.441
We have to meet.

00:05:12.841 --> 00:05:13.362
I'm leaving.

00:05:13.362 --> 00:05:14.362
Looks like rain's coming.

00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:14.922
Bye.

00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:15.641
See you.

00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:16.682
Let me tell you.

00:05:17.722 --> 00:05:20.242
You're already a notorious playboy.

00:05:21.042 --> 00:05:23.321
Don't try to be a homewrecker now.

00:05:26.362 --> 00:05:26.841
Yan.

00:05:55.841 --> 00:05:56.641
What do you want?

00:05:57.401 --> 00:05:58.881
I'm quite happy today.

00:05:59.002 --> 00:05:59.922
Does that involve me?

00:06:07.802 --> 00:06:09.482
I heard you rejected Jiang Liang.

00:06:10.162 --> 00:06:10.881
You even told him

00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:12.521
our problem could be resolved.

00:06:13.002 --> 00:06:13.922
Of course.

00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:15.562
With a divorce.

00:06:26.162 --> 00:06:26.881
Shen Haoming.

00:06:29.201 --> 00:06:31.521
Our marriage started without dignity.

00:06:32.362 --> 00:06:33.841
Just take what we need.

00:06:35.081 --> 00:06:37.441
Now I just want us to part peacefully.

00:06:38.881 --> 00:06:39.881
Don't worry.

00:06:40.641 --> 00:06:41.881
I promised your parents

00:06:43.802 --> 00:06:45.401
to minimize public fallout.

00:06:46.081 --> 00:06:47.521
I'll keep my word.

00:06:48.881 --> 00:06:49.961
I just want us

00:06:50.401 --> 00:06:52.722
to smoothly obtain
the divorce certificate

00:06:52.722 --> 00:06:53.841
in our second attempt.

00:06:55.242 --> 00:06:56.081
Please cooperate.

00:07:05.201 --> 00:07:06.362
Remove your hand.

00:07:18.881 --> 00:07:20.162
Stop taking up the elevator.

00:07:41.362 --> 00:07:41.961
You're back.

00:07:42.362 --> 00:07:42.961
You're here.

00:07:43.722 --> 00:07:45.682
Got off work early
and help you clean up.

00:07:46.122 --> 00:07:47.122
I cut some fruits.

00:07:47.122 --> 00:07:47.841
Have some.

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:49.321
Thanks.

00:07:51.242 --> 00:07:52.321
I saw from the balcony

00:07:52.321 --> 00:07:53.802
you returning with Jiang Liang.

00:07:54.002 --> 00:07:55.521
You're getting close lately.

00:07:56.281 --> 00:07:58.281
Not really, just for work.

00:07:59.802 --> 00:08:00.242
So,

00:08:00.482 --> 00:08:01.641
you feel nothing about him?

00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:02.281
Nothing.

00:08:22.242 --> 00:08:24.162
What about you and Shen Haoming?

00:08:26.602 --> 00:08:27.562
At the resort,

00:08:27.562 --> 00:08:28.761
something happened, right?

00:08:29.602 --> 00:08:31.281
You're quite nosy.

00:08:34.161 --> 00:08:35.561
You and Shen Haoming

00:08:35.561 --> 00:08:37.082
are finalizing the divorce,

00:08:37.561 --> 00:08:38.521
but I know

00:08:38.801 --> 00:08:41.401
you wanted to form a family with him.

00:08:42.842 --> 00:08:43.962
You loved him so much,

00:08:44.602 --> 00:08:45.921
and now you're parting.

00:08:46.082 --> 00:08:47.242
You must be sad.

00:08:47.281 --> 00:08:49.681
All my focus and energy now

00:08:50.122 --> 00:08:51.122
are on work.

00:08:51.401 --> 00:08:52.561
No time for others.

00:08:53.561 --> 00:08:55.082
It's good to focus on work,

00:08:55.482 --> 00:08:56.521
but I believe

00:08:56.801 --> 00:08:58.842
even decisive people get confused

00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:00.801
and don't know what to do sometimes.

00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:02.842
So I think

00:09:03.602 --> 00:09:05.041
you'd better think carefully

00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:06.561
and clarify your feelings

00:09:06.602 --> 00:09:07.521
before deciding.

00:09:07.602 --> 00:09:08.561
Strawberries are good.

00:09:08.561 --> 00:09:09.082
Try one.

00:09:09.242 --> 00:09:10.281
I know they're sweet.

00:09:10.761 --> 00:09:11.881
Am I right?

00:09:17.801 --> 00:09:19.082
You're quite right.

00:09:19.362 --> 00:09:20.202
You mentioned

00:09:20.202 --> 00:09:21.561
the peach blossom makeup concept.

00:09:22.002 --> 00:09:22.962
What about the plan?

00:09:23.641 --> 00:09:24.161
Moreover,

00:09:24.561 --> 00:09:25.482
want two assistants,

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:26.002
right?

00:09:26.242 --> 00:09:27.122
How's that going?

00:09:27.322 --> 00:09:28.362
They are indeed sweet.

00:09:28.362 --> 00:09:28.842
I'm leaving.

00:09:28.842 --> 00:09:29.881
Check the resumes.

00:09:30.761 --> 00:09:32.401

I've carried this ring with me,

00:11:35.002 --> 00:11:36.442
hoping you can forgive me.

00:11:38.561 --> 00:11:40.202

Why are you still here?

00:12:32.761 --> 00:12:33.801
Get out now!

00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:37.761
Look at what you have become.

00:12:38.281 --> 00:12:39.602
Learn to love yourself

00:12:39.602 --> 00:12:40.561
before loving others.

00:12:41.881 --> 00:12:43.362
Be an independent woman

00:12:43.442 --> 00:12:44.681
who stays clear-headed.

00:12:45.362 --> 00:12:46.281
Have your own career,

00:12:46.322 --> 00:12:47.281
your own life,

00:12:48.202 --> 00:12:49.641
and courage to walk away anytime.

00:12:50.962 --> 00:12:52.801
Be a relaxed and independent woman.

00:12:53.041 --> 00:12:54.161
Live for yourself.

00:12:57.161 --> 00:12:58.962
If I can't be with Haoming,

00:13:01.761 --> 00:13:03.921
I'd rather stay single forever.

00:13:07.041 --> 00:13:08.401
Stay single forever?

00:13:09.281 --> 00:13:10.962
I thought about this before.

00:13:12.401 --> 00:13:13.122
Let me show you.

00:13:15.442 --> 00:13:16.322
When we get old,

00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:19.281
we could find a premium nursing home.

00:13:21.002 --> 00:13:21.482
And then,

00:13:21.561 --> 00:13:24.161
we could take art and music classes.

00:13:24.761 --> 00:13:25.681
When we get bored,

00:13:25.962 --> 00:13:27.401
go sing karaoke, or dance.

00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:28.202
Interesting?

00:13:29.482 --> 00:13:30.442
Here, look.

00:13:32.202 --> 00:13:33.521
This one is run by my friend.

00:13:33.842 --> 00:13:34.681
Go visit sometime?

00:13:42.082 --> 00:13:43.202
Are you insane?

00:13:43.842 --> 00:13:45.561
Who would be in a nursing home with you?

00:13:48.082 --> 00:13:48.561
Let go!

00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:49.482
Let go of me!

00:14:16.801 --> 00:14:17.521
Thinking?

00:14:18.761 --> 00:14:19.681
All these years,

00:14:20.401 --> 00:14:22.082
you've been chasing Shen Haoming,

00:14:22.602 --> 00:14:24.161
yet he married someone else,

00:14:24.881 --> 00:14:26.322
didn't even care about you.

00:14:28.161 --> 00:14:29.761
If there's a chance to ruin him,

00:14:31.242 --> 00:14:32.242
are you interested?

00:14:37.161 --> 00:14:39.002
Why suggest that?

00:14:47.082 --> 00:14:47.842
Because of you.

00:14:49.442 --> 00:14:50.161
I don't want

00:14:52.202 --> 00:14:54.122
you sinking deeper into darkness.

Still haven't eaten at this hour?

00:15:10.842 --> 00:15:12.122
Mr. Shen is out.

00:15:12.242 --> 00:15:14.082
He told me to put this in his office.

00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:16.242
I'm going.

00:15:16.242 --> 00:15:17.041
Want my help?

00:15:18.722 --> 00:15:19.442
Well,

00:15:19.962 --> 00:15:20.602
thanks then.

00:15:21.362 --> 00:15:22.202
No need.

00:15:22.401 --> 00:15:23.041
Go eat now.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.696
(Yan Studio)

00:16:00.281 --> 00:16:01.242
As you can see,

00:16:01.281 --> 00:16:02.641
our first batch of videos

00:16:03.442 --> 00:16:04.602
exceeds 10,000 views each.

00:16:05.122 --> 00:16:06.281
The top video

00:16:06.281 --> 00:16:07.681
even surpasses 60,000 clicks.

00:16:08.161 --> 00:16:09.881
Therefore, I think we can move on

00:16:09.881 --> 00:16:11.161
to production phase.

00:16:11.602 --> 00:16:12.362
Fantastic!

00:16:12.362 --> 00:16:14.122
Finally reaching phase two.

00:16:15.362 --> 00:16:15.881
Okay.

00:16:16.202 --> 00:16:17.962
Today's meeting is

00:16:17.962 --> 00:16:19.281
to finalize first collection

00:16:19.322 --> 00:16:20.602
and production quantities.

00:16:23.521 --> 00:16:26.041
I've compiled all sample video metrics

00:16:26.041 --> 00:16:27.041
for review.

00:16:27.122 --> 00:16:28.881
These five pieces
received the most likes

00:16:28.881 --> 00:16:30.242
and the highest engagement.

00:16:30.681 --> 00:16:32.401
And the highest number
of positive reviews.

00:16:33.002 --> 00:16:33.641
In my opinion,

00:16:33.641 --> 00:16:35.362
sometimes we have to trust the netizens.

00:16:35.842 --> 00:16:37.362
Their taste is as good as mine.

00:16:37.842 --> 00:16:39.281
I also think they are the best.

00:16:40.161 --> 00:16:42.281
Let me share a different perspective.

00:16:42.921 --> 00:16:44.842
The biggest highlight
of these five pieces

00:16:44.881 --> 00:16:46.962
is that they all use brocade fabric.

00:16:47.401 --> 00:16:50.002
But this also is
their biggest challenge.

00:16:50.041 --> 00:16:51.281
Because this brocade fabric

00:16:51.281 --> 00:16:54.161
is handwoven by ethnic minorities.

00:16:54.362 --> 00:16:55.761
So, it showcases

00:16:55.761 --> 00:16:58.082
such intricate craftsmanship
and exquisite texture.

00:16:58.921 --> 00:17:02.641
However, their output
is extremely limited.

00:17:03.482 --> 00:17:04.162
Well,

00:17:04.321 --> 00:17:06.041
should we first set up a cooperation

00:17:06.041 --> 00:17:07.442
with the producers?

00:17:08.841 --> 00:17:10.642
But hand-weaving is always

00:17:10.682 --> 00:17:12.361
slower compared to machinery.

00:17:13.041 --> 00:17:14.922
What if they can't meet our demand?

00:17:15.722 --> 00:17:18.081
I've thought about this before.

00:17:18.882 --> 00:17:21.402
But we're still in the early phase,

00:17:22.202 --> 00:17:24.561
so a small-batch
yet high-quality approach

00:17:24.561 --> 00:17:25.561
suits us better.

00:17:25.841 --> 00:17:26.442
Financially,

00:17:26.442 --> 00:17:28.002
it's safer and more secure.

00:17:29.202 --> 00:17:30.041
For the first batch,

00:17:30.041 --> 00:17:31.536
I want us to focus on

00:17:31.696 --> 00:17:32.601
excellence,

00:17:32.761 --> 00:17:33.361
precision,

00:17:33.841 --> 00:17:34.642
and reputation.

00:17:35.561 --> 00:17:37.281
As for what Yao mentioned,

00:17:38.202 --> 00:17:39.321
we can transform

00:17:39.482 --> 00:17:40.962
the challenge of brocade production

00:17:41.281 --> 00:17:44.841
into online marketing
advantages and highlights.

00:17:45.882 --> 00:17:47.002
Many niche designer brands

00:17:47.002 --> 00:17:48.321
are now adopting

00:17:48.561 --> 00:17:49.722
a limited edition

00:17:49.722 --> 00:17:50.841
plus pre-sale model.

00:17:50.922 --> 00:17:52.281
We can consider this approach too.

00:17:53.722 --> 00:17:56.442
For the five styles for the first batch,
100 pieces each.

00:17:56.601 --> 00:17:58.081
If we can achieve this,

00:17:58.642 --> 00:18:00.081
it could be a success.

00:18:04.841 --> 00:18:05.402
Xiaowan,

00:18:05.962 --> 00:18:07.482
any ideas for online promotion?

00:18:08.202 --> 00:18:10.761
We could organize
reward-based activities

00:18:10.801 --> 00:18:11.722
to extend the timeline.

00:18:11.761 --> 00:18:14.121
This would buy us time for production.

00:18:16.242 --> 00:18:18.002
Any other problem to discuss?

00:18:19.121 --> 00:18:20.041
Based on Wan's plan,

00:18:20.041 --> 00:18:21.922
I'll recruit more influencers

00:18:21.962 --> 00:18:23.242
to promote us.

00:18:23.521 --> 00:18:25.081
Regarding the fees

00:18:25.242 --> 00:18:26.801
for these influencers,

00:18:26.801 --> 00:18:28.081
could you give me an estimate?

00:18:28.242 --> 00:18:28.521
Sure.

00:18:28.561 --> 00:18:29.361
I'll send it to you.

00:18:29.521 --> 00:18:30.002
Good.

00:18:32.722 --> 00:18:34.841
I can reach out to bloggers,

00:18:34.841 --> 00:18:36.121
offer them free makeup services,

00:18:36.121 --> 00:18:37.962
and let them wear our outfits in posts.

00:18:37.962 --> 00:18:39.162
That should help, right?

00:18:46.121 --> 00:18:47.202
Why did you ask to meet?

00:18:47.722 --> 00:18:48.962
Can't I just want to see you?

00:18:49.202 --> 00:18:50.561
Join me for afternoon tea?

00:18:51.002 --> 00:18:51.922
Sure.

00:18:54.041 --> 00:18:54.801
How have you been?

00:18:55.442 --> 00:18:56.642
Haven't seen you in days.

00:18:57.162 --> 00:18:58.442
Focus on work

00:18:58.442 --> 00:19:00.442
or on someone?

00:19:03.882 --> 00:19:05.841
No one understands me like you do.

00:19:06.321 --> 00:19:07.402
Same old me.

00:19:08.321 --> 00:19:11.242
I can't stand seeing
female friends suffering,

00:19:11.242 --> 00:19:12.561
so I have to help them.

00:19:12.761 --> 00:19:13.682
What can I do?

00:19:14.402 --> 00:19:17.521
There are too many female friends
you want to help.

00:19:18.281 --> 00:19:19.482
Which one this time?

00:19:21.482 --> 00:19:21.962
Xu Yan.

00:19:24.722 --> 00:19:25.601
Xu Yan?

00:19:29.642 --> 00:19:30.801
Are you out of your mind?

00:19:32.041 --> 00:19:33.962
Xu Yan is Shen Haoming's wife.

00:19:34.361 --> 00:19:35.521
We're in the negotiation.

00:19:37.002 --> 00:19:38.002
So what?

00:19:38.321 --> 00:19:39.521
I'm her investor.

00:19:39.962 --> 00:19:40.561
Besides,

00:19:40.561 --> 00:19:41.482
heard the rumors?

00:19:41.482 --> 00:19:42.521
They're getting divorced.

00:19:42.601 --> 00:19:43.801
I don't care about rumors.

00:19:44.442 --> 00:19:46.442
But I don't want you to help her.

00:19:56.242 --> 00:19:56.962
Haochen.

00:19:58.321 --> 00:19:59.402
What is it, Coach Lu?

00:19:59.682 --> 00:20:00.722
I want to recommend you

00:20:00.761 --> 00:20:02.922
for this year's
Junior Equestrian Championship.

00:20:03.521 --> 00:20:04.121
However,

00:20:04.121 --> 00:20:05.841
we need to consult
your family's opinions.

00:20:06.041 --> 00:20:07.281
Have your family come over

00:20:08.162 --> 00:20:10.682
to discuss your training schedule
for the second half.

00:20:11.761 --> 00:20:13.361
Just call my sister-in-law.

00:20:13.442 --> 00:20:14.922
She handles all my affairs.

00:20:15.281 --> 00:20:15.682
Alright.

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:16.841
I'll contact her.

00:20:21.482 --> 00:20:22.002
Haoming.

00:20:22.202 --> 00:20:23.041
Come here.

00:20:23.081 --> 00:20:24.761
I've got amazing news!

00:20:25.041 --> 00:20:26.642
If you want to join the championship,

00:20:26.642 --> 00:20:29.361
the technical difficulty and
training intensity will both increase.

00:20:29.361 --> 00:20:30.922
Haochen is very interested himself.

00:20:31.162 --> 00:20:33.321
I wonder what you two think.

00:20:36.521 --> 00:20:37.922
Haochen has trained for four years.

00:20:38.601 --> 00:20:39.841
If he's interested,

00:20:40.081 --> 00:20:41.321
I'll definitely support him.

00:20:45.801 --> 00:20:47.202
Honey, what do you think?

00:20:54.801 --> 00:20:55.482
Coach Lu,

00:20:56.402 --> 00:20:57.761
Haochen's records show

00:20:57.761 --> 00:20:59.521
he's completed
over 350 training sessions.

00:21:02.281 --> 00:21:03.722
If he wants to participate,

00:21:03.722 --> 00:21:04.962
we'll definitely support him.

00:21:06.682 --> 00:21:07.841
But I have one question.

00:21:08.242 --> 00:21:09.561
He's nearly 160 cm tall.

00:21:10.482 --> 00:21:12.242
His current horse might be too small.

00:21:12.841 --> 00:21:14.002
If it's too small,

00:21:14.162 --> 00:21:15.801
jumping obstacles could be dangerous.

00:21:18.281 --> 00:21:18.722
Yes.

00:21:18.882 --> 00:21:19.682
For the competition,

00:21:19.682 --> 00:21:21.801
we'll adjust equipment to his height.

00:21:22.361 --> 00:21:23.242
Glad to hear that.

00:21:23.321 --> 00:21:23.642
Okay.

00:21:24.242 --> 00:21:26.482
I'll start working on the registration.

00:21:27.321 --> 00:21:27.882
Thank you.

00:21:28.682 --> 00:21:29.242
- Thanks.
- Not at all.

00:21:29.242 --> 00:21:29.801
Thank you.

00:21:36.242 --> 00:21:37.081
Call me anytime.

00:21:37.242 --> 00:21:37.761
I'm leaving.

00:21:39.121 --> 00:21:40.002
Wait!

00:21:42.682 --> 00:21:43.361
Well,

00:21:44.041 --> 00:21:45.922
the fresh juices here are tasty.

00:21:45.922 --> 00:21:46.841
Want to try some?

00:21:48.402 --> 00:21:48.801
Sure!

00:21:48.801 --> 00:21:49.801
I'll go get you some.

00:21:50.081 --> 00:21:51.002
Wait for me!

00:21:59.561 --> 00:22:00.922
The juice here is pretty good.

00:22:03.442 --> 00:22:04.162
I know.

00:22:19.722 --> 00:22:20.561
Sit down and wait?

00:22:30.361 --> 00:22:32.162
Please tell Haochen

00:22:32.841 --> 00:22:34.002
I need to leave now.

00:22:34.801 --> 00:22:36.561
I left a meeting halfway to come here.

00:22:37.682 --> 00:22:38.081
Okay.

00:22:38.761 --> 00:22:39.361
Thanks.

00:22:56.601 --> 00:22:57.202
Where's she?

00:22:57.841 --> 00:22:59.002
She had work to attend to

00:22:59.801 --> 00:23:00.281
and left.

00:23:00.682 --> 00:23:02.482
Why are you still sitting here?

00:23:03.242 --> 00:23:04.041
Oh my!

00:23:06.162 --> 00:23:08.202
You're driving me crazy!

00:23:08.442 --> 00:23:10.281
Even I know

00:23:10.361 --> 00:23:11.722
you should fix your mistakes.

00:23:11.962 --> 00:23:13.841
You made her mad,

00:23:13.922 --> 00:23:15.002
and now she's ignoring you.

00:23:15.002 --> 00:23:16.402
You need to do something!

00:23:19.642 --> 00:23:21.081
Yan has been sincere

00:23:21.722 --> 00:23:23.041
to Haochen.

00:23:24.402 --> 00:23:25.281
After all,

00:23:25.962 --> 00:23:27.361
it's all for you.

00:23:28.601 --> 00:23:30.081
Otherwise, to her,

00:23:30.442 --> 00:23:32.281
Haochen is just some random child.

00:23:35.561 --> 00:23:37.121
She's always adored Haochen.

00:23:37.922 --> 00:23:38.922
Why involves me?

00:23:39.361 --> 00:23:40.482
Of course, it involves you.

00:23:40.761 --> 00:23:42.002
"Love me, love my dog."

00:23:42.722 --> 00:23:44.561
She loves you,

00:23:45.002 --> 00:23:47.121
so she values our family.

00:23:48.202 --> 00:23:49.642
After you two married,

00:23:50.121 --> 00:23:51.081
she's treated me,

00:23:51.561 --> 00:23:52.321
your father,

00:23:52.402 --> 00:23:53.121
and Haochen

00:23:53.402 --> 00:23:54.642
with sincerity.

00:23:55.081 --> 00:23:57.601
Her care has always been tangible.

00:23:58.281 --> 00:23:59.841
And I truly felt it.

00:24:02.761 --> 00:24:05.321
After decades in business,

00:24:06.121 --> 00:24:08.601
I've encountered all types of people.

00:24:09.962 --> 00:24:11.442
But when Yan looks at you,

00:24:12.081 --> 00:24:15.321
I can tell how deeply she loves you.

00:24:18.442 --> 00:24:19.801
Actually,

00:24:19.962 --> 00:24:21.402
it's part of my fault that you two

00:24:22.041 --> 00:24:23.442
are getting divorce now.

00:24:25.841 --> 00:24:26.922
From the start,

00:24:27.202 --> 00:24:29.521
I wanted you to marry someone matched

00:24:30.402 --> 00:24:32.601
so I was harsh to Yan,

00:24:33.402 --> 00:24:34.642
and tried every mean

00:24:34.761 --> 00:24:35.801
to drive her away.

00:24:37.321 --> 00:24:39.002
I deeply regret that now.

00:24:41.002 --> 00:24:42.801
Had I not done those,

00:24:43.482 --> 00:24:45.642
she wouldn't have lied
about her family backgrounds

00:24:46.482 --> 00:24:48.242
to prove herself.

00:24:51.041 --> 00:24:52.722
I've no right

00:24:53.121 --> 00:24:54.361
to blame her for deceiving me.

00:24:56.162 --> 00:24:57.081
From the beginning,

00:24:58.162 --> 00:24:59.041
I'd already decided

00:24:59.882 --> 00:25:01.801
to hide Haochen's background.

00:25:04.801 --> 00:25:07.041
Now that you've talked things through,

00:25:07.482 --> 00:25:09.922
I think you may get back together.

00:25:12.202 --> 00:25:12.801
Haoming.

00:25:14.321 --> 00:25:15.242
I truly cherish Yan

00:25:15.242 --> 00:25:16.242
as my daughter-in-law.

00:25:18.041 --> 00:25:21.482
She reminds me of my younger self.

00:25:22.882 --> 00:25:23.882
Driven,

00:25:24.561 --> 00:25:26.121
hardworking,

00:25:27.162 --> 00:25:28.321
able to handle both society

00:25:29.041 --> 00:25:30.081
and hard labor.

00:25:31.041 --> 00:25:33.041
When she did supermarket live streams,

00:25:33.841 --> 00:25:34.761
she swallowed her pride

00:25:35.041 --> 00:25:36.002
and standing on her own.

00:25:36.761 --> 00:25:38.321
She made no excuses

00:25:38.321 --> 00:25:39.882
for her mistakes,

00:25:40.601 --> 00:25:42.041
but fight for what she wanted

00:25:42.321 --> 00:25:44.162
through sheer determination.

00:25:45.922 --> 00:25:47.242
That's when I knew

00:25:48.002 --> 00:25:50.561
she was meant to be
the hostess of Shen Family.

00:25:51.321 --> 00:25:52.121
Just like you,

00:25:54.761 --> 00:25:56.761
she's a pillar of our family.

00:25:57.482 --> 00:25:58.321
Promise me.

00:25:59.081 --> 00:26:00.642
No matter what it takes,

00:26:01.482 --> 00:26:03.081
bring Yan back.

00:26:05.081 --> 00:26:06.242
When I married her,

00:26:07.761 --> 00:26:09.361
I vowed to never let go.

00:26:12.722 --> 00:26:13.561
You can do this.

00:26:30.402 --> 00:26:30.801
Come on.

00:26:30.801 --> 00:26:31.561
Good job.

00:26:32.041 --> 00:26:32.922
That's it for today.

00:26:35.281 --> 00:26:35.801
Lin.

00:26:35.922 --> 00:26:37.041
I'll book you again.

00:26:37.402 --> 00:26:37.922
Thank you.

00:26:39.041 --> 00:26:39.801
See you Friday.

00:26:39.841 --> 00:26:40.121
Got it.

00:26:40.321 --> 00:26:40.841
Bye.

00:26:41.402 --> 00:26:41.922
Take care.

00:26:47.922 --> 00:26:48.442
Zheng!

00:26:49.121 --> 00:26:50.121
Are you okay?

00:26:50.402 --> 00:26:51.120
Twisted my ankle.

00:26:51.321 --> 00:26:52.162
Can you move?

00:26:52.442 --> 00:26:52.922
It hurts.

00:26:53.121 --> 00:26:53.761
I can't move.

00:26:55.002 --> 00:26:56.002
Let's go to the hospital.

00:26:56.561 --> 00:26:57.281
Don't delay.

00:26:57.601 --> 00:26:58.041
Let's go.

00:26:58.041 --> 00:26:58.601
Come on.

00:26:58.882 --> 00:26:59.482
Hello, sir.

00:27:02.722 --> 00:27:04.801
The doctor let him stay
a few days for observation.

00:27:11.601 --> 00:27:12.162
Bye.

00:27:27.002 --> 00:27:27.761
Scumbag!

00:27:28.482 --> 00:27:30.402
I knew you weren't sincere with Lin.

00:27:32.002 --> 00:27:32.601
Lin.

00:27:33.041 --> 00:27:34.642
Come to the hospital cafeteria now.

00:27:34.882 --> 00:27:36.281
See what Yu Yiming's been doing

00:27:36.281 --> 00:27:37.242
(Jingzhou Yuekang Hospital, Outpatient)
behind your back.

00:27:45.642 --> 00:27:46.722
Outrageous.

00:27:47.121 --> 00:27:48.442
Just now she held his hand.

00:27:48.841 --> 00:27:50.521
Now he's patting her shoulder.

00:27:50.922 --> 00:27:51.882
They've been together

00:27:51.882 --> 00:27:52.962
for 26 minutes.

00:27:53.202 --> 00:27:54.121
In front of me,

00:27:54.121 --> 00:27:55.682
he keeps declaring his love for you.

00:27:56.002 --> 00:27:56.962
Look what he's doing!

00:27:57.402 --> 00:27:59.162
Touchy-feely in public.

00:27:59.162 --> 00:28:00.081
No sense of propriety.

00:28:00.962 --> 00:28:02.962
He's practically a male coquette!

00:28:03.482 --> 00:28:04.242
Shut up!

00:28:05.121 --> 00:28:06.162
Stop rambling.

00:28:07.841 --> 00:28:09.202
Move away.

00:28:12.202 --> 00:28:12.761
Lin.

00:28:13.202 --> 00:28:13.722
Lin.

00:28:14.882 --> 00:28:15.521
Scumbag!

00:28:15.601 --> 00:28:16.361
Senior.

00:28:18.882 --> 00:28:20.848
This is my first patient

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.761
who died since I became a resident.

00:28:32.242 --> 00:28:32.922
Wenjin.

00:28:34.801 --> 00:28:36.642
I've been through these too.

00:28:39.081 --> 00:28:40.642
There are patients we want to save

00:28:41.962 --> 00:28:42.761
but can't.

00:28:43.242 --> 00:28:45.761
When we face their grieving family,
we don't know what to say.

00:28:46.761 --> 00:28:47.882
I know

00:28:49.002 --> 00:28:50.242
how hard it is

00:28:52.121 --> 00:28:53.482
for you.

00:28:54.601 --> 00:28:55.761
But as doctors,

00:28:56.081 --> 00:28:58.242
we must face this and overcome it.

00:29:01.321 --> 00:29:03.202
There are other patients waiting for us.

00:29:03.561 --> 00:29:04.041
Lin.

00:29:05.521 --> 00:29:06.081
Lin.

00:29:08.002 --> 00:29:08.521
Lin!

00:29:10.482 --> 00:29:11.601
Please listen to me.

00:29:11.962 --> 00:29:12.402
Go ahead.

00:29:13.561 --> 00:29:15.121
I know you're hurting.

00:29:16.442 --> 00:29:19.761
But you must see his true nature.

00:29:21.121 --> 00:29:23.002
Yu Yiming's conditions are good.

00:29:24.242 --> 00:29:24.801
I admit that.

00:29:26.682 --> 00:29:28.482
But people living in big cities

00:29:28.682 --> 00:29:30.321
think realistically.

00:29:31.281 --> 00:29:32.601
Your social status, background,

00:29:32.601 --> 00:29:33.321
education, and job

00:29:33.321 --> 00:29:34.521
are worlds apart from his.

00:29:34.722 --> 00:29:36.402
Do you really think he doesn't care?

00:29:39.162 --> 00:29:39.482
Lin Tao.

00:29:39.482 --> 00:29:40.841
I don't care what you saw.

00:29:40.962 --> 00:29:41.841
I just believe

00:29:41.841 --> 00:29:43.761
that Yu Yiming is not that kind of man.

00:29:44.442 --> 00:29:45.002
Well, Lin.

00:29:45.002 --> 00:29:46.761
Why don't you believe me?

00:29:46.761 --> 00:29:48.121
I'm the one who truly...

00:29:53.722 --> 00:29:54.962
Where's that bruise from?

00:29:55.442 --> 00:29:56.521
You fought?

00:29:56.922 --> 00:29:57.521
Well...

00:29:58.402 --> 00:30:00.080
I'm now a sparring partner
at an MMA gym.

00:30:01.761 --> 00:30:02.482
Why?

00:30:03.202 --> 00:30:03.962
To take punches.

00:30:04.642 --> 00:30:05.801
You like hitting people.

00:30:06.002 --> 00:30:06.841
No problem.

00:30:07.202 --> 00:30:08.482
If hitting me makes you happy,

00:30:08.922 --> 00:30:09.962
just do it.

00:30:10.162 --> 00:30:10.682
Lin.

00:30:11.081 --> 00:30:13.442
I'm ready to be
your punching bag for life.

00:30:19.561 --> 00:30:20.202
Lin Tao.

00:30:21.081 --> 00:30:22.202
The matter between us

00:30:22.761 --> 00:30:24.041
has dragged on long enough.

00:30:27.162 --> 00:30:29.081
Can we calmly

00:30:29.081 --> 00:30:30.321
talk it through today?

00:30:32.242 --> 00:30:32.801
Okay.

00:30:36.121 --> 00:30:36.682
I know

00:30:37.962 --> 00:30:39.242
you gave a lot

00:30:40.002 --> 00:30:41.041
to this relationship.

00:30:42.002 --> 00:30:43.722
But we've both realized we're not right

00:30:43.722 --> 00:30:44.882
for each other.

00:30:45.402 --> 00:30:47.041
Breaking up is the best choice.

00:30:49.121 --> 00:30:50.962
We're never getting back together.

00:30:53.561 --> 00:30:54.442
So,

00:30:55.402 --> 00:30:56.722
I hope you can let go.

00:30:58.442 --> 00:30:59.801
Don't you want me to be happy?

00:31:01.682 --> 00:31:03.722
I am now.

00:31:04.601 --> 00:31:05.601
Look,

00:31:05.601 --> 00:31:06.521
I've got my sister

00:31:06.922 --> 00:31:09.041
and my startup team by my side.

00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:11.642
My life is full and busy.

00:31:14.121 --> 00:31:15.041
I also hope

00:31:16.642 --> 00:31:18.402
that you get back

00:31:18.601 --> 00:31:19.922
on your own path.

00:31:20.761 --> 00:31:21.321
Lin Tao.

00:31:23.361 --> 00:31:24.482
I wish you well too.

00:31:30.162 --> 00:31:30.642
I'll leave.

00:31:42.202 --> 00:31:42.922
Lin.

00:31:44.402 --> 00:31:45.552
Take good care of yourself.

00:31:48.962 --> 00:31:49.922
How's Xu Yan's company

00:31:49.922 --> 00:31:51.041
doing lately?

00:31:51.402 --> 00:31:53.561
They're doing great.

00:31:53.962 --> 00:31:55.521
Their newly released short videos

00:31:55.601 --> 00:31:56.841
get over 10,000 likes,

00:31:57.482 --> 00:32:00.281
all with much better quality.

00:32:01.682 --> 00:32:02.521
Currently,

00:32:02.682 --> 00:32:03.761
this market is competitive.

00:32:04.002 --> 00:32:05.521
With numerous production stages,

00:32:06.002 --> 00:32:07.722
achieving such results this fast

00:32:08.002 --> 00:32:08.841
is truly remarkable.

00:32:10.722 --> 00:32:13.482
No wonder Jiang Liang
has been showing off.

00:32:14.281 --> 00:32:15.841
Actually, I think

00:32:16.402 --> 00:32:17.922
Yan works hard

00:32:18.442 --> 00:32:19.482
just to prove her worth

00:32:19.482 --> 00:32:20.561
and strength to you.

00:32:21.041 --> 00:32:22.002
These days

00:32:22.281 --> 00:32:25.002
people want equal and balanced love.

00:32:25.321 --> 00:32:26.841
She's an independent woman.

00:32:27.682 --> 00:32:29.002
Surely she wants to succeed first

00:32:29.002 --> 00:32:29.801
before returning.

00:32:31.722 --> 00:32:32.682
Really?

00:32:32.922 --> 00:32:33.482
Absolutely.

00:32:33.808 --> 00:32:34.642
Think about it.

00:32:34.962 --> 00:32:37.801
If she really wanted to cut ties,

00:32:38.321 --> 00:32:40.041
why would she agree to the resort trip?

00:32:40.442 --> 00:32:41.841
Why would she help you

00:32:42.202 --> 00:32:43.482
win over Mr. Baraikin?

00:32:46.642 --> 00:32:47.242
Three days.

00:32:47.521 --> 00:32:48.521
You have to be together

00:32:48.521 --> 00:32:50.002
all the time,

00:32:50.482 --> 00:32:51.722
pretending to be close,

00:32:52.521 --> 00:32:53.882
even sharing a room.

00:32:55.801 --> 00:32:56.642
Let me tell you.

00:32:57.402 --> 00:32:59.801
If a woman truly hates a man,

00:33:00.081 --> 00:33:01.761
she wouldn't spend
even a second with him.

00:33:03.882 --> 00:33:04.882
Remember

00:33:05.242 --> 00:33:08.281
the romantic room at Yanbo Resort?

00:33:08.722 --> 00:33:09.882
That passionate setup.

00:33:11.002 --> 00:33:12.321
Yan didn't object at all, right?

00:33:15.761 --> 00:33:18.321
You did a good job.

00:33:18.561 --> 00:33:21.722
If she truly had no feelings left,
why would she do that?

00:33:22.601 --> 00:33:24.482
But she keeps wanting a divorce.

00:33:25.162 --> 00:33:26.521
That's just anger talking.

00:33:28.321 --> 00:33:30.202
My girlfriend used to threaten breakup

00:33:30.521 --> 00:33:31.402
when got mad.

00:33:31.682 --> 00:33:32.242
Really.

00:33:34.962 --> 00:33:37.162
How did you become such a smooth talker?

00:33:37.962 --> 00:33:38.482
Sit down.

00:33:40.601 --> 00:33:41.162
Keep going.

00:33:44.402 --> 00:33:45.561
Now,

00:33:45.841 --> 00:33:47.682
to win her back

00:33:47.722 --> 00:33:48.801
by direct communication

00:33:49.281 --> 00:33:50.361
is hard.

00:33:50.841 --> 00:33:53.081
But there's a method that always works.

00:33:53.162 --> 00:33:53.922
What is it?

00:33:54.722 --> 00:33:55.601
Indirect strategy.

00:33:56.402 --> 00:33:57.841
Go find her friends.

00:33:57.962 --> 00:33:58.801
That would help.

00:33:58.922 --> 00:33:59.402
No use.

00:33:59.761 --> 00:34:01.482
I tried Qiao Lin, but she refused.

00:34:02.041 --> 00:34:03.361
What about male friends?

00:34:04.002 --> 00:34:04.922
At such times,

00:34:05.081 --> 00:34:06.482
men often understand each other.

00:34:08.561 --> 00:34:10.442
Male friends?

00:34:13.762 --> 00:34:14.882
She does have one.

00:34:42.041 --> 00:34:42.704
Coming!

00:34:44.592 --> 00:34:45.872
Qiao Lin. Perfect timing.

00:34:45.872 --> 00:34:47.792
I'm making breakfast
and want to bring you some.

00:34:47.792 --> 00:34:48.521
Take any seat.

00:34:54.561 --> 00:34:55.762
- I'll get you some fruit.
- Wait.

00:34:56.362 --> 00:34:57.641
I have something to say.

00:34:58.842 --> 00:34:59.561
Go ahead.

00:35:00.641 --> 00:35:01.521
Sit down.

00:35:08.561 --> 00:35:09.201
Yu Yiming.

00:35:13.161 --> 00:35:13.882
I like you.

00:35:17.002 --> 00:35:18.442
- Qiao Lin, actually...
- Let me finish.

00:35:18.561 --> 00:35:19.161
Okay.

00:35:24.081 --> 00:35:27.601
Yes, I always do what I want,

00:35:28.161 --> 00:35:29.962
but I'm not that naive.

00:35:32.121 --> 00:35:33.282
I'm very aware

00:35:33.442 --> 00:35:35.521
of the real differences between us.

00:35:36.041 --> 00:35:38.201
Those can't be ignored.

00:35:42.402 --> 00:35:43.842
I know there are

00:35:44.282 --> 00:35:45.681
many outstanding people around you.

00:35:45.962 --> 00:35:47.802
Like that female doctor

00:35:47.802 --> 00:35:49.081
I saw in the cafeteria.

00:35:49.762 --> 00:35:51.081
Realistically,

00:35:51.201 --> 00:35:52.681
they're more successful,

00:35:52.721 --> 00:35:55.362
and also better matches for you.

00:35:55.482 --> 00:35:57.362
You share the same profession

00:35:58.161 --> 00:35:59.521
so you'd have more topics

00:35:59.601 --> 00:36:00.561
and pursuits in common.

00:36:01.081 --> 00:36:01.442
However,

00:36:02.762 --> 00:36:05.121
I don't think this means

00:36:05.121 --> 00:36:06.322
I'm unworthy of liking you.

00:36:10.482 --> 00:36:12.041
I believe

00:36:12.521 --> 00:36:13.962
you have the right to choose.

00:36:15.002 --> 00:36:15.612
So...

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.362
If you think

00:36:18.362 --> 00:36:20.282
she is more suitable,

00:36:22.802 --> 00:36:25.241
I won't force it.

00:36:32.842 --> 00:36:33.482
Qiao Lin.

00:36:37.121 --> 00:36:38.201
What's with you today?

00:36:39.561 --> 00:36:40.762
Did something happen to you?

00:36:44.721 --> 00:36:45.882
Yesterday,

00:36:45.882 --> 00:36:47.041
at the hospital cafeteria,

00:36:47.041 --> 00:36:48.521
I saw you with Dr. Xu.

00:36:49.402 --> 00:36:50.402
She looked distressed

00:36:50.681 --> 00:36:52.121
and you tried to comfort her.

00:36:52.201 --> 00:36:53.362
She seemed to need you.

00:36:56.282 --> 00:36:57.721
I-I don't know what to say.

00:36:59.442 --> 00:37:00.208
Didn't sleep well?

00:37:04.161 --> 00:37:05.442
Yesterday,

00:37:06.081 --> 00:37:06.922
it was her first time

00:37:07.002 --> 00:37:08.241
losing a patient.

00:37:08.362 --> 00:37:09.521
So I consoled her.

00:37:10.041 --> 00:37:10.922
But rest assured.

00:37:11.241 --> 00:37:13.121
There's nothing beyond colleagues.

00:37:13.561 --> 00:37:14.041
Really.

00:37:16.762 --> 00:37:17.802
I trust you.

00:37:18.962 --> 00:37:20.282
Also, I trust your character.

00:37:20.721 --> 00:37:23.482
But the reality between us

00:37:24.282 --> 00:37:25.521
still exist.

00:37:26.882 --> 00:37:27.962
I don't know

00:37:27.962 --> 00:37:30.081
if it will create obstacles

00:37:30.201 --> 00:37:31.241
for us.

00:37:32.402 --> 00:37:33.161
So...

00:37:34.482 --> 00:37:37.721
Maybe we should

00:37:38.161 --> 00:37:39.362
take a week apart

00:37:39.442 --> 00:37:40.521
to think it over.

00:37:42.402 --> 00:37:43.482
No, Qiao Lin. I don't...

00:37:45.521 --> 00:37:46.362
This week,

00:37:47.081 --> 00:37:48.002
don't contact me.

00:37:55.842 --> 00:37:56.362
Okay.

00:37:58.482 --> 00:37:59.762
Once I confirm it,

00:37:59.762 --> 00:38:00.681
I'll message you.

00:38:06.922 --> 00:38:07.402
Alright.

00:38:09.842 --> 00:38:10.482
How's it going?

00:38:11.041 --> 00:38:12.322
I've secured cooperation

00:38:12.322 --> 00:38:14.842
with three weaving villages
for brocade production.

00:38:15.442 --> 00:38:17.282
They'll supply us long-term.

00:38:18.442 --> 00:38:19.362
That's good.

00:38:19.721 --> 00:38:20.882
Now we can send orders

00:38:20.882 --> 00:38:21.762
to the factory.

00:38:21.962 --> 00:38:22.601
I'll follow up.

00:38:22.601 --> 00:38:23.241
Wait a second.

00:38:24.442 --> 00:38:25.002
Sit down.

00:38:28.962 --> 00:38:30.681
Did something happen?

00:38:31.241 --> 00:38:31.962
Look at you.

00:38:39.802 --> 00:38:41.282
There are only two people

00:38:41.322 --> 00:38:42.442
that can make you

00:38:42.601 --> 00:38:44.041
be this shaken.

00:38:45.161 --> 00:38:46.402
One is Lin Tao,

00:38:47.762 --> 00:38:49.002
the other is Yu Yiming.

00:38:49.161 --> 00:38:49.721
Which one?

00:38:50.282 --> 00:38:51.721
Yu Yiming, of course.

00:38:54.962 --> 00:38:57.081
Young love during school days
was so simple.

00:38:57.721 --> 00:38:59.962
No need to think about
the future or the outcomes,

00:39:00.002 --> 00:39:01.561
just loved.

00:39:02.521 --> 00:39:03.561
But now,

00:39:03.762 --> 00:39:05.442
the more I want to be with someone,

00:39:06.121 --> 00:39:08.721
the more I can't help
thinking about reality.

00:39:13.121 --> 00:39:14.322
That means you've grown up.

00:39:15.842 --> 00:39:17.161
You used to be so carefree.

00:39:17.681 --> 00:39:19.376
How could you ever
ponder over such things?

00:39:19.641 --> 00:39:21.241
When I was young,

00:39:21.802 --> 00:39:23.561
I thought love was all sweet.

00:39:24.081 --> 00:39:25.521
But now I understand

00:39:26.322 --> 00:39:27.882
there isn't just sweetness,

00:39:27.882 --> 00:39:29.161
but bitterness,

00:39:29.521 --> 00:39:30.442
insecurity,

00:39:30.762 --> 00:39:31.402
pride,

00:39:31.601 --> 00:39:32.282
and pain.

00:39:32.842 --> 00:39:37.201
All kinds of contradictions intertwined.

00:39:38.002 --> 00:39:39.882
But I just can't let go.

00:39:50.521 --> 00:39:52.241
I understand how you feel right now.

00:39:58.081 --> 00:39:59.561
But this is what love is.

00:40:02.842 --> 00:40:05.081
Everything you just said

00:40:05.721 --> 00:40:07.521
is part of love.

00:40:09.442 --> 00:40:10.561
Don't run from it.

00:40:10.922 --> 00:40:12.041
You can't run anyway.

00:40:13.561 --> 00:40:15.802
So you could try to accept it,

00:40:16.442 --> 00:40:17.161
understand it,

00:40:17.922 --> 00:40:18.762
and feel it.

00:40:19.561 --> 00:40:21.482
Maybe in that process,

00:40:22.121 --> 00:40:23.681
you'll find the answers you seek.

00:40:24.962 --> 00:40:26.802
No need to drain yourself like this.

00:40:28.241 --> 00:40:29.241
That's true.

00:40:33.081 --> 00:40:33.922
I'll think about it.

00:40:34.121 --> 00:40:34.681
I'm leaving.

00:40:37.282 --> 00:40:37.842
Wait.

00:40:38.641 --> 00:40:39.601
Well...

00:40:40.081 --> 00:40:42.121
Don't forget the makeup class.

00:40:44.681 --> 00:40:45.201
Okay.

00:40:45.362 --> 00:40:45.882
Bye.

00:40:47.002 --> 00:40:47.842
Goodbye.

00:40:57.498 --> 00:41:01.360
(Yan Studio)

00:41:05.601 --> 00:41:06.282
Yu Yiming.

00:41:10.681 --> 00:41:11.760
You're here for my sister?

00:41:13.482 --> 00:41:13.962
Yes.

00:41:15.561 --> 00:41:16.561
Your coworkers said

00:41:16.802 --> 00:41:17.721
she isn't here.

00:41:18.601 --> 00:41:19.681
So I'm waiting here.

00:41:23.002 --> 00:41:24.362
Does she not want to see me?

00:41:26.362 --> 00:41:27.601
She really isn't here.

00:41:28.161 --> 00:41:30.442
This morning she had makeup class,

00:41:30.721 --> 00:41:32.362
this afternoon a beauty launch event.

00:41:32.802 --> 00:41:34.802
She's looking for the newest products

00:41:34.962 --> 00:41:36.521
and preparing for the entrance exams.

00:41:37.201 --> 00:41:38.041
She's busy.

00:41:38.322 --> 00:41:39.201
Even I barely see her.

00:41:39.762 --> 00:41:41.482
Don't overthink it.
She really isn't here.

00:41:43.721 --> 00:41:44.442
Got it.

00:41:45.322 --> 00:41:46.641
Qiao Lin has told me

00:41:46.641 --> 00:41:47.762
about you two.

00:41:49.121 --> 00:41:50.521
I think she's right.

00:41:52.041 --> 00:41:53.041
If you ignore

00:41:53.241 --> 00:41:55.041
these differences now,

00:41:55.442 --> 00:41:57.041
bigger issues might arise later.

00:41:57.882 --> 00:41:59.402
So you both should calm down

00:41:59.561 --> 00:42:00.601
and think carefully

00:42:00.962 --> 00:42:02.641
whether you can accept it.

00:42:04.681 --> 00:42:05.521
She's more rational

00:42:05.962 --> 00:42:07.081
than before.

00:42:07.802 --> 00:42:09.296
That means you're important to her.

00:42:09.922 --> 00:42:11.081
Do you get me?

00:42:13.081 --> 00:42:13.882
Okay, I understand.

00:42:15.882 --> 00:42:16.802
I'll wait patiently.

00:42:18.482 --> 00:42:19.521
These flowers...

00:42:19.641 --> 00:42:20.521
I'll give them to her.

00:42:21.721 --> 00:42:22.322
Thank you.

00:42:23.322 --> 00:42:23.922
I'm leaving.

00:42:25.322 --> 00:42:25.922
Take care.

00:42:40.561 --> 00:42:41.002
Hello?

00:42:42.922 --> 00:42:43.762
I'm Shen Haoming.

00:42:45.002 --> 00:42:45.922
Shen Haoming?

00:42:58.721 --> 00:42:59.521
What's up?

00:43:01.402 --> 00:43:01.922
Have a seat.

00:43:11.601 --> 00:43:12.161
Thank you.

00:43:13.922 --> 00:43:15.282
You like Xu Yan, don't you?

00:43:18.282 --> 00:43:19.482
Don't get me wrong.

00:43:20.041 --> 00:43:20.641
Yes.

00:43:21.882 --> 00:43:23.282
I had feelings for her,

00:43:24.402 --> 00:43:25.882
but that was many years ago.

00:43:26.442 --> 00:43:27.802
I admit when I saw her again,

00:43:28.402 --> 00:43:29.362
I still had a soft spot.

00:43:30.601 --> 00:43:32.041
But I know that's not love.

00:43:33.561 --> 00:43:35.241
Besides, I'm now with Qiao Lin.

00:43:39.161 --> 00:43:41.402
I know you're not involved with her.

00:43:42.322 --> 00:43:43.402
I asked you here today

00:43:44.362 --> 00:43:45.482
to request your help.

00:43:46.322 --> 00:43:47.201
How can I help?

00:43:47.762 --> 00:43:49.442
You've known her since childhood.

00:43:50.201 --> 00:43:51.721
You must understand her well, right?

00:43:53.201 --> 00:43:54.962
I hope you can help me win her back.

00:43:57.521 --> 00:43:58.521
You're mistaken.

00:43:59.002 --> 00:44:01.081
Qiao Lin and I have problems too.

00:44:02.922 --> 00:44:04.081
I don't know how to help you.

00:44:04.802 --> 00:44:06.041
Where are things now?

00:44:06.521 --> 00:44:07.632
Breakup cooling-off period.

00:44:10.282 --> 00:44:10.802
And you?

00:44:11.402 --> 00:44:12.560
Divorce cooling-off period.

00:44:12.721 --> 00:44:13.402
Let me toast you.

00:44:17.201 --> 00:44:18.362
So you're saying

00:44:19.561 --> 00:44:23.641
you used to think you didn't love her,
but now you've fallen for her again?

00:44:24.282 --> 00:44:24.962
No.

00:44:25.081 --> 00:44:26.762
After we broke up...

00:44:27.641 --> 00:44:28.802
It's not "fallen again".

00:44:30.201 --> 00:44:31.482
I've always loved her.

00:44:38.002 --> 00:44:40.282
But I've never felt this lost before.

00:44:40.962 --> 00:44:42.721
I don't know what to do

00:44:42.721 --> 00:44:44.282
to get her back.

00:44:44.842 --> 00:44:46.041
I only know one thing.

00:44:47.041 --> 00:44:48.081
I won't let her go.

00:44:48.362 --> 00:44:49.442
Let me tell you.

00:44:51.402 --> 00:44:52.362
I hadn't seen Xu Yan

00:44:52.402 --> 00:44:53.641
since high school graduation.

00:44:54.322 --> 00:44:56.081
When we met again in Jingzhou,

00:44:56.442 --> 00:44:57.721
she told me she was married.

00:44:58.121 --> 00:44:59.161
The way she said it

00:44:59.201 --> 00:45:00.482
was overflowing

00:45:00.802 --> 00:45:01.922
with happiness.

00:45:02.922 --> 00:45:03.962
The radiance

00:45:05.121 --> 00:45:06.161
on her face

00:45:07.561 --> 00:45:09.081
was something I'd never seen.

00:45:09.922 --> 00:45:10.641
Really?

00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:11.681
You got married?

00:45:15.241 --> 00:45:15.922
Yes, last month.

00:45:18.041 --> 00:45:18.962
Though it's a bit late,

00:45:20.201 --> 00:45:21.081
congratulations.

00:45:22.842 --> 00:45:24.762
I could tell she was truly happy then.

00:45:26.041 --> 00:45:26.882
It's all my fault.

00:45:27.402 --> 00:45:29.121
I've always been slow

00:45:29.121 --> 00:45:30.402
to express myself.

00:45:31.442 --> 00:45:32.681
Always realize things too late.

00:45:33.922 --> 00:45:34.922
You think you're alone?

00:45:38.521 --> 00:45:39.521
I'm the same.

00:45:40.002 --> 00:45:41.402
After I met Qiao Lin again,

00:45:42.322 --> 00:45:43.561
she's always by my side,

00:45:45.561 --> 00:45:46.402
supporting,

00:45:47.241 --> 00:45:48.081
encouraging,

00:45:49.842 --> 00:45:50.641
and caring.

00:45:54.442 --> 00:45:55.922
And it still takes me so long

00:45:57.201 --> 00:45:58.601
to realize that I like her.

00:46:05.802 --> 00:46:06.762
Let's team up.

00:46:07.641 --> 00:46:09.362
The women we love are sisters.

00:46:10.482 --> 00:46:11.442
Our love lives

00:46:12.721 --> 00:46:14.161
are just as bumpy.

00:46:15.201 --> 00:46:16.282
We need to help each other.

00:46:17.241 --> 00:46:17.762
Makes sense.

00:46:17.962 --> 00:46:18.882
When Lin ignores me,

00:46:19.442 --> 00:46:20.521
you can reach her for me.

00:46:20.842 --> 00:46:21.922
When Xu Yan avoids you,

00:46:22.521 --> 00:46:23.842
I can speak to her.

00:46:24.161 --> 00:46:24.882
That's...

00:46:26.561 --> 00:46:27.482
strength in numbers.

00:46:28.282 --> 00:46:29.962
Two are better than one.

00:46:30.322 --> 00:46:31.121
You're right.

00:46:31.802 --> 00:46:32.464
Brother-in-law.

00:46:32.882 --> 00:46:33.520
Brother-in-law.

00:46:35.442 --> 00:46:36.176
Brother-in-law.

00:46:36.402 --> 00:46:37.072
