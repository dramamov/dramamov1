Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let’s get out of here.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.100
I don’t want to run away from
problems anymore.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.500
I want to go back and face them.
I want to make things right.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.780
Call off your plan and leave.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:37.670
Damn it!

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:40.970
Jett, are you okay?

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.250
I’m fine.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.550
What about the rest of us?

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.310
Everyone else is back here at the pub.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.010
That jerk could control
people’s minds that much?

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.700
My plan fell apart all because of him.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.990
We did everything we could.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.500
There has to be a way
to deal with his power.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.300
What do you think you’re doing?

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.750
I’m just worried Mr. Mekhin
might feel cold.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.300
I’m talking about...

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.500
how you guys barged into this place

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.850
and how you’re just
standing here like that.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.100
These vampires are my family.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.100
I won’t let your group hurt them
without fighting back.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.980
This isn’t the time to pick a fight, Ciar.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.300
It’s not like I want to talk
to that human,

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.530
but I can’t just stand by and do nothing,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.010
watching him walk around
comfortably in our home

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.300
after he’s just killed our family!

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.170
I can’t do what you’re doing, Master.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.300
If Punn had really known about it,

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.110
he wouldn’t have let it happen.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.150
I wouldn’t have either.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.700
I don’t know if you really didn’t know,

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.400
or were just pretending to have no idea.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.610
If they wanted to come up with
an evil plan,

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.300
they could find a way to hide it from you.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.300
You’ve been lied to before.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.970
Why do you trust

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.200
and believe in humans?

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.480
You keep letting him lead you by the nose.
Haven’t you learned your lesson?

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.100
Watch your words, Ciar.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.850
You’re being disrespectful to Master.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.450
What I’m saying is true.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.200
Your Master is putting humans
before his family.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.580
We’ve been attacked.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.500
So many of us have been killed.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.700
Even Mekhin is injured.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.970
Why are you still protecting
this two-faced human?

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.600
If you don’t care about us,

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.600
then as a leader, you should at least
think about our clan members who died.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:21.399
Ciar!

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.800
Are you happy now?

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.100
You’ve brainwashed us vampires
and turned us against each other.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.200
Maybe this is one of the Hunters’ plans.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.310
I don’t care what our leader thinks.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.100
I won’t stand by and let them hurt us.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.300
I’m going to get revenge.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.370
Anyone who agrees can follow me.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:45.570
What is it?

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.150
(An 18-year-old is asking
to enter the pub.)

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.950
Anyone underage cannot enter!

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.430
Please let me in.
I’m not here to hang out.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:53.400
I’m here to talk about
something important.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.300
My boss is in a bad mood right now.
Please don’t cause any trouble.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:57.030
Just go.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.400
Your boss is Jett, right?

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.400
Tell him my name is Pokpong.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.500
I’m Punn’s brother. Jett knows me.

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.170
Please let me in.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:09.900
You can tell Jett.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.180
Hey, kid.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.100
Who did you say was your brother?

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.950
Have a seat.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.900
What do you want to talk to me about?

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.210
I haven’t been able to reach Punn.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.900
I…

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.450
I need to talk to him.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.700
I went to the gallery
on your business card,

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.600
but they said you’ve been
at the pub lately.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.210
That’s why I came to see you here.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.800
Have you been able to reach Punn?

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.750
Have you talked to him at all?

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.500
What’s so urgent that
you need to talk to Punn?

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.500
I found a lot of strange weapons
in the house, in Punn’s hidden room.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.850
I’m worried he’s involved in
dangerous stuff.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.890
Don’t worry, Pokpong.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.570
I’ll take you to see Punn.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.900
If you water them too much,
they might die.

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:04.300
These roses look beautiful,
but they need special care.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.850
They get a lot of pests
and are sensitive to water and the sun.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:11.900
You have to handle them with extreme care.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.400
I wish I could read these roses’ minds.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:25.700
I wish I knew what they wanted
and what was wrong with them,

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.300
so I could take the best care of them.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:37.350
I feel really bad for being the reason
your family is fighting.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:45.300
If family means the people I love,

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.500
then you’re my family too.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.010
But what about Ciar?

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:57.780
I know Ciar well.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:00.550
You have to give him time.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.850
It’s not worth following him right now.
He won’t listen.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.700
I’m really worried about you, Mr. Ramil.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.500
I don’t want to get you in trouble.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:14.950
I’m worried about you too, Punn.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:19.600
And I don’t want you to think
you’re a troublemaker.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:27.400
From now on, I want you to talk to me.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:29.700
Can you do that, Punn?

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.300
I don’t want you to feel alone.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.100
I really appreciate that, Mr. Ramil.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.100
I’ve never received this kind of love.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.600
Get used to it, because from now on,

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:08.400
I’ll love and take care of you
as best I can,

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:14.250
even more than these roses.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.300
But you said these roses are
hard to look after.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.420
Even though they’re hard to look after,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.300
once they bloom,
they become the most beautiful.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:32.600
Thank you, Mr. Punn,
for taking such good care of me.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.180
Your Master is the one
taking good care of you.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.000
Just rest and recover for now.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.210
Don’t go out making mischief just yet.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.300
Where would I go?

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.350
I just have to go back to work
at the hospital.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.100
Where’s Ciar?

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:54.780
Did he go out?

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.650
He has a little problem.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:07.600
It’s okay.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.600
I’ll find the right time to talk to him.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.700
But for now, you should rest.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:29.100
What about the Hunters?
What are we going to do with them?

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.300
I’m gathering information.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:37.700
If we want to end the conflict, we have to
at least know their real motive.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.700
If you’re going to do anything about Ciar,
be careful.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:45.180
Don’t be another one causing trouble.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.800
Well…

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.800
Vampires are such posers, right?

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.050
But you’re also a vampire, Mr. Mekhin.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.100
You don’t have to be so polite.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.200
If we’re only counting human years,

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:16.100
I might be younger than you.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:20.500
I think you’re right.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.800
You’re the youngest in the family, Mekhin.

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:31.500
I’m so happy when people call me
the youngest of my three amazing brothers.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.850
What about you, Punn?

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:35.700
Do you have any siblings?

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.150
I have a younger brother.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.790
But my family doesn’t really get
to spend time together.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.900
And I’m not a cool big brother like yours.

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:52.700
Don’t think like that.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.700
My brothers?

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.000
One can run fast.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:59.600
One can talk to crows.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:01.600
One can read minds.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:07.500
But none of my cool brothers has the power
to make a delicious porridge like this.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:15.700
Thank you, Mekhin, the youngest brother.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:20.000
Yes, Punn, the oldest brother.

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:25.200
Alright, have some porridge.

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:25.980
Thank you.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:28.500
Wow, that looks so good.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.450
WINNALA ANTIQUE
BUYING, SELLING, REPAIR & CONSERVATION

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.700
Oh, Pokpong is not here.

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.300
Yeah, I guess he’s still
at his part-time job.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:03.300
Come on.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.650
FROM POKPONG: I WON’T BE BACK FOR A WEEK.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:39.700
Punn, what do we do with this
green plant called broc-something?

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.500
Do we need to put it in the fridge?

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:15.100
Why do you seem so distracted?

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:17.250
Me?

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:18.400
Mmm.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.000
Are you worried about Pokpong?

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.900
He normally just disappears like this.

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:30.500
Why are you worried this time?

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.350
Because he normally just disappears.

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:36.400
That's why I’m worried.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.300
He never texted me how many days
he’d be gone, but he did this time.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:56.550
Relax, Punn.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.900
He might be home with his new family.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.300
Hmm…

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.700
Or maybe he’s been caught up
with his friends.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:10.099
Or maybe he’s dating someone.

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:14.000
It’s not like Pong to run off
to be with a partner.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.300
You ran off to be with me.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.200
What’s gotten into you?

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:25.500
I’m just trying to cheer you up.

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:30.600
Anyway, I’m hungry.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:31.650
Come on.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:37.600
Hmm?

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:40.380
We were so busy shopping
at the supermarket today

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.710
that we haven't eaten.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.600
Why didn’t you tell me you were hungry?

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:49.500
Because I wanted to eat your cooking.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:57.950
Here.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:04.150
Is this a rabbit?

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:08.200
Hey. That’s a steamed bun.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:11.700
Eat it. It’s tasty.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.000
Hey.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:22.100
Steamed Punn.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.400
What are you doing?

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.350
Hey, not yet.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:31.800
Remove the paper first.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:33.700
Let go.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.700
This is paper. You can’t eat it.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:53.700
You really are a cool big brother.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:57.800
A cool big brother?

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:00.000
Yeah.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:06.600
Mr. Mekhin told me you’re a cool
and smart big brother.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:11.000
You know what to do
and when to say things.

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:13.980
I get your little brothers.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.000
Just having you makes me feel better.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:25.770
Hmm…

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:29.100
Little brothers?

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:33.300
Yeah, they’re your little brothers.

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:44.650
Little Punn.

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:49.400
What are you doing? Keep eating.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.650
Careful not to choke.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:07.600
Pokpong is not here.

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:10.000
He hasn’t been home in a while.

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.000
Have you called or contacted him at all?

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:18.700
I last spoke to him last week.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.300
I called to ask him about
moving to the US.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.600
I’m not sure if he’d go with us.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:29.600
If you see him, can you ask him for me?

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.750
Sure, I’ll let you know.

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:33.100
I won’t take any more of your time.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.500
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.500
Don’t worry.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.050
Pokpong might be at work.

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:48.750
Let’s go check.

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:55.310
Hi.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:56.850
Hi.

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.100
Oh my god, Dr. Mekhin!

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:08.010
Where have you been?

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:09.700
We’ve missed you so much.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.300
I was sick, so I took some time off.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.370
Oh, no. Please take care of yourself.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.380
You’re a doctor. Don’t get sick.

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:20.520
Everyone has been asking about you.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.330
Both the patients and the nurses.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.700
Really?

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.400
Can I have some?

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:33.650
Thank you.

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:44.900
Excuse me.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:46.900
Did Pokpong not come to work today?

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.100
He quit.

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.700
What?

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:53.380
He quit?

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:54.010
Yes.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:01.500
What? Pokpong is your younger brother?

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:04.300
Yes.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:09.100
The human world is really small, isn’t it?

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.700
You know Pokpong?

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:13.550
Yes.

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:16.300
How long have you known him?

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:19.400
Well, I’ve known him for a while.

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:22.880
I buy snacks there often.

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:23.700
Mmm.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:27.200
So we started chatting here and there
and became friends

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:28.700
I enjoy talking to him.

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:35.300
I’ve never known anything
about my brother.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.700
Honestly, Punn.

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:46.900
I don’t even know
what Ciar and Methus like to eat.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:58.900
Thank you so much, Mr. Mekhin,

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.000
for keeping Pokpong company.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.300
He’s a lonely kid.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:06.650
He doesn’t have many friends.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:11.300
But this one is a lazy kid.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.200
Master!

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:20.700
I’m going to talk to the shop owner.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.950
Speaking of Ciar,

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.600
have you seen him at all?

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:42.750
Not at all.

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.000
I haven’t been able to reach him.

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:49.200
I’m so worried about him.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.010
I don’t know what he’s thinking.

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:55.050
I thought I knew him well,

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:59.100
but sometimes I don’t know
what’s on his mind.

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:04.650
Hey, but if you’re going to find him,

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:08.300
don’t do anything risky, got it?

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:09.800
Yes, Master.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.130
I don’t like having problems
with anyone anyway.

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:19.600
By the way, you smell like blood.

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:21.900
Doesn’t it affect you at all?

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.400
It does, but I can control myself...

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:29.700
by coming outside
and having a snack like this.

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:33.350
Would you like to try some?

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:42.600
What kind of food does
a 100-plus-year-old vampire eat?

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:48.650
I eat…uh…

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:51.210
Steamed buns.

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:53.710
Steamed buns?

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:54.450
Yeah.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.000
Why steamed buns?

00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:58.700
Punn bought them for me.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.500
Your heart belongs to the steamed buns.

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:07.200
What are you talking about?

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:08.340
Nothing.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.450
Would you like some grape juice instead?

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.350
No.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.390
What did you talk to the shop owner about?

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:30.500
I asked him if Pong had any problems
while he was working here,

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:33.100
but he doesn’t know,

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:35.350
because they weren’t here
at the same time.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.090
They didn’t really get to see each other.

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:40.100
Pong won’t call me back.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:43.000
Who knows if he’s gotten himself
in trouble again?

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:45.900
My crazy brother.

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:54.200
Here.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:57.100
You eat this kind of thing?

00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:59.800
My crazy brother gave it to me.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.250
Have some.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.100
Eat this

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:17.800
Open your mouth.

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:19.400
Ah.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.800
I haven’t seen him
since he got suspended from school.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:37.100
Have you contacted or called him at all?

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:39.600
Have I called him?

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.500
The day before yesterday, I called
to ask him to play a game with me,

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:44.700
but he didn’t answer.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.420
When I texted him, this was his reply.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.000
WHY DIDN’T YOU PICK UP MY CALLS?
JOIN ME IN THE GAME.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.610
NOT A GOOD TIME.
I’M SLEEPING OVER AT MY PARTNER’S.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.350
I guess he’s secretly dating someone.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.100
It’s okay. He’ll get back to you.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:03.800
I have to go. Bye.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:05.710
Thank you so much.

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:12.700
Could he really be dating someone

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.300
and that’s why
he just disappeared like this?

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:16.000
Do you want to look somewhere else?

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.300
I can’t think of anywhere else.

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:22.850
Let’s go home.

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:24.850
You must be tired.

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:28.200
Let’s go.

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:30.300
Wait, Punn.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:33.500
Let’s play the claw machine.

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:35.000
- Come on.
- Huh?

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:36.910
Let’s play the claw machine.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.590
I’m definitely going to win this time.

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:42.990
Come on. Let’s play this.

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:47.960
Let me help.

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.800
I think we should get this one.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.200
Let’s get this one.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:53.100
Okay.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:55.710
Yes!

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.700
No!

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.310
Ready? I’m going to press the button.

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:08.600
- What? You pressed it already?
- Here we go.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:11.400
Yay!

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:13.500
Hey.

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.800
I told you I’d win the doll this time.

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:19.800
How’s this possible?

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:22.800
I got it.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.300
Can I try again?

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.300
Get one more so we can match.

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:34.000
No! We’ve used up the coins.

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:45.050
Here. This is yours.

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:49.100
It’s okay. We can just have one.

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:51.310
Alright then.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:53.010
I want to go home now.

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.910
Let’s go.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:07.210
MICHAEL ORPHANAGE

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:32.900
Hello, are you here
to treat the kids to a meal?

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:36.800
They’ve already eaten and gone
to their rooms for their afternoon nap.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:40.400
Hello. I was just passing by
and thought I’d come in and see.

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:42.700
How long has this place been here?

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.290
Almost 10 years,
but I only moved here a few years ago.

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:50.000
But the building looks like it’s been
here much longer than that.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:50.800
You’re right.

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:53.300
Something terrible happened here.

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:56.500
What happened?

00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:00.200
No one here wants to talk about it,

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:05.700
even though Father Dracul
survived the incident.

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:07.700
I’m sorry to hear that,

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.300
but who’s Father Dracul?

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:18.400
He’s the priest who owns this orphanage.

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:23.700
And you said he survived?

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.400
He survived along with three kids.

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.900
They’ve all split up now.

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:36.050
Father was badly injured in the incident
and is now bedridden.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:41.600
He’s being cared for here
by Sister Teresa.

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:46.200
Sister, can I visit him?

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:49.200
I’m afraid that’s not a good idea.

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:52.200
He’s unconscious.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.100
Is that so?

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:58.500
In that case, may I know his name again?

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:01.000
I’ve been looking for someone.

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:02.800
I want to know if it’s the same person.

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:07.300
You won’t find him on the internet.

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.400
He doesn’t like having his photos taken.

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:14.350
Oh,

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:16.950
but you can see what he looks like.

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:25.400
There aren’t any photos,
but there’s a drawing of him.

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.100
Here.

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:35.900
This is Father Dracul.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.090
WINNALA ANTIQUE
BUYING, SELLING, REPAIR & CONSERVATION

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:54.850
You must be tired today.

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:57.410
Aren’t you?

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.400
I’m a vampire.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:02.100
I don’t get tired that easily.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.800
I’ve probably been tired
from everything lately.

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:12.310
Ever since Jett and the others
stormed into the hotel,

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.100
so many things happened
and there’s been a lot to think about.

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:31.300
Humans are so complicated.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.300
Why?

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:36.500
Are you saying vampires
don’t have much to think about?

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:41.450
It’s because you’re still alive, Punn.

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:03.800
You still have flesh,

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:06.800
feelings,

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.100
and breath.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.300
I was born as a vampire.

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:20.200
I don’t know what it’s like to breathe.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:52.710
Having a beating heart
is so exciting, Punn.

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:59.700
Whether it beats fast or slow...

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.200
depends on your feelings at the moment.

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:11.900
Everything you feel is because
you're still alive.

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:31.800
I’m sorry I killed your clan members
in the past.

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:47.600
Do you hate me for lying to you?

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:51.900
Do you hate me for being a hunter?

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:56.800
I think...

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.400
I’ll have to ask my boss.

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.100
What boss?

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:07.890
Hmm…

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:11.800
This is him. He’s my boss.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.250
What a goofy vampire.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:22.200
Chomp.

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:26.700
Does he look like me?

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:29.310
Does he?

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:32.300
No.

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:34.300
Agreed.

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.000
I’m more handsome.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:51.800
Here.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.500
There’s something even spicier than this.

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:54.700
It’s called Mala.

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.290
Ma?

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:03.600
Not “Ma” like a dog.

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:10.000
Give me your hand.

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:12.500
I’m not a dog.

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:15.750
No water for you.

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:17.080
Hey!

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.400
Do you even know how to wash the dishes?

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:21.300
- Have you squeezed out the dish soap?
- Of course!

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:28.700
Is that a steamed bun?

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:30.700
No, it’s a steamed Punn.

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:34.700
Hey, if you make a mess,
you’ll have to clean it up yourself.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:38.780
Ouch! It got in my eye!

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:39.750
It got in my eye!

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.410
- Punn!
- Here?

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:42.100
Yes.

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:44.290
Hey!

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:50.700
You wanna play, huh?

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:51.600
Bring it.

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:00.500
Let’s wash the dishes.

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:04.100
You’re supposed to wash the dishes,
not make bubbles.

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:07.700
Do you know how to brush your teeth?

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:09.700
This is how you do it.

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:13.400
You have to brush up and down like this.

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:16.800
No!

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:18.800
- You don’t have to shake your head.
- Oh?

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.800
Just brush with your hand like this.

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:23.910
Hey.

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:27.220
Like this?

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:44.700
I feel like I’m older than
everything here.

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:48.500
That’s probably true.

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:54.200
I opened this shop
because I like old things.

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:02.610
What about you?

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:05.300
Do you like me?

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:08.110
Of course I do.

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:11.200
Since when?

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:27.000
Since you released me from the painting.

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:31.200
I thought I was going to
dry up and die in there.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:42.200
What about you? When did you fall for me?

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:46.900
I’m not sure.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.600
Since the first time we met
inside the painting?

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:58.000
Actually, I feel like I’ve met you before.

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:01.700
I’ve dreamed about you so often...

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:05.700
that I thought it was really you.

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:10.000
The man in my dreams

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.800
even wears the same necklace as you.

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:23.700
Is it possible that you’re the man
I’ve been dreaming about?

00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:32.900
Is it possible that you’re the one
I’ve been searching for all this time?

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:48.100
♪ Tell me it’s you, it’s you,
and it's real ♪

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:52.730
♪ The one who will take away

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:25.700
Pokpong, this is Punn’s real workplace.

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.200
Why are you acting like
it’s some big secret?

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.600
You saw the hidden room in Punn’s house.

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:42.600
Do you think his work is a secret?

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.800
How long are you going to keep my phone?

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:46.700
It’s the rule.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.200
I already asked for your permission

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.700
and you agreed in exchange
for Punn’s story.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:14.600
Sis, why are you so moody?

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:17.650
People have errands to run. It’s normal.

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:18.280
Yeah.

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:22.430
I wouldn’t be moody if Jett told me
what errand he’s on.

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.700
I’m worried he might
do something risky again.

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:26.400
He’s been acting weird lately.

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.540
Sis, you don’t have to worry.

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:32.500
Jett just found a new way
to deal with the vampires.

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:37.210
What way?

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.000
Did you guys invent a new weapon for him?

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.550
Just wait and see, sis.

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:47.900
This weapon is like a hack.

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:53.090
Whether it’s a human or a vampire,
they all die because of love.

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:54.870
What do you think?

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:55.910
What do you think, sis?

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:12.200
Hey, are you shocked?

00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:14.900
Does Punn really work here?

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:16.800
Why would I lie to you?

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.700
Punn and I grew up together.

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.550
We built this place together.

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:27.230
Hey, Jett. Why did you come to
the base alone today?

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:28.100
Where are the others?

00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:29.500
They’re busy with other things.

00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:31.700
Long time no see.

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.250
How was the mission
to investigate vampires abroad?

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.110
Did everything go well?

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:36.000
Yeah, it went well.

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:38.100
Is it true that Punn is staying
with the vampires?

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:39.900
I’m busy.

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:41.700
Let’s talk next time.

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:50.700
Is your story about vampires true?

00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:53.600
Why would I lie to you?

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:03.900
The Hunters’ job is
to annihilate those vampires.

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.300
You don’t have to believe
the supernatural stuff yet,

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:14.200
but Punn is being held by them.

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:15.200
That’s true.

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:18.800
Why did they capture him?

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:23.400
He was sent to investigate them,
but they caught him.

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:27.220
The other day, the other Hunters and I
stormed into their place.

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:30.600
They must be very angry.

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:32.810
They took Punn away without a trace.

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.650
But I believe that Punn is still alive.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.300
He’s still useful to them.

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.300
When are you going
to break in there again?

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:42.700
Why?

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:45.550
You want to join us?

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:48.000
Punn is my only family left.

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:53.510
Can I join the Hunters?

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:57.500
Just let me help rescue him,
that’s all I ask.

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:09.250
Is everything alright?

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:12.090
I went to find clues about the Hunters.

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:15.660
Mr. Punn,

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.290
please stay and listen too.

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:23.290
Okay.

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:43.500
You know the person in the drawing?

00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:50.900
How did you get this drawing?

00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:53.500
When I was out looking for information

00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:56.400
about why the Hunters want to get rid of us,

00:44:57.110 --> 00:44:59.100
I went to the Michael Orphanage.

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:00.750
You went there?

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:04.290
Yes, I did.

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:07.490
And I got this drawing of the priest
who owns that place.

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:09.600
The priest?

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:10.810
Why?

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:13.710
What does Father Dracul
have to do with this?

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.890
How do you guys know about him?

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:22.800
I only remember
that he died in the incident.

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:25.500
No, he didn’t, Mr. Punn.

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:30.200
I just found out
that Father Dracul is alive.

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:36.810
Feratu, my younger half-brother
from a different mother.

00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:40.600
After being expelled from the family,
he disappeared.

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:44.300
I think he’s Father Dracul,

00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:50.600
the owner of the orphanage
where you lived.

00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:54.800
Yes.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:12.900
Tonight, we’ll teach them
not to mess with the vampires again!

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:14.500
Nom, nom.

00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:15.610
Come on.
