(Yan Studio)
Granny!

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.840
You're so happy today.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.239
Got good news

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:59.999
to share with me?

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:01.120
Look at our outfits.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.999
Pretty, right?

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.320
We made them ourselves.

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:05.999
Grandma, take a closer look.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.439
Every stitch

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:10.040
is pure handwork.

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:10.959
You must know this.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.519
Every single stitch represents
our intangible heritage.

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:14.200
Grandma.

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:15.280
- Look.
- The entire outfit.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.880
Doesn't Lin look like a model?

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:17.799
Pretty, right?

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.519
Like a model, huh?

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:21.600
Let me show you Yan's outfit.

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:22.440
Look at me.

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:24.600
- Is that pretty?
- You look great, really.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.320
Let me get you closer.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.160
Look at her.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.959
Does she look like a businesswoman?

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.119
- What do you think?
- Absolutely!

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.799
Look closer.

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.280
We made all of this ourselves.

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:34.000
Look.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.704
Gorgeous, right?

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:36.200
What do you think?

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:37.839
Lovely! So lovely!

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:39.600
When you wear this,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.600
you just look like a little fairy!

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.720
Then you're the fairy queen!

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.440
- Right?
- Yes!

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.519
You're the most pretty,

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:47.760
the most lovely fairy queen!

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.920
By the way,

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.760
we made a custom set just for you.

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.000
We'll bring it to you.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.040
If I wear clothes

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.679
made by you girls,

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.440
then I'll "look cute"!

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:00.559
Grandma.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.920
You've been on your phone a lot!

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.679
You even know "look cute" now.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.799
But that's not popular anymore.

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:10.160
I am Yan Studio's

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.399
number one superfan!

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.320
You also know that?

00:03:15.408 --> 00:03:16.688
Watched many live streams too.

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:19.040
Alright.

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:21.399
Next time

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:22.679
when you take photos,

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:23.959
send me more, okay?

00:03:24.112 --> 00:03:24.839
Okay.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.000
Got it.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.959
Okay.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.200
We'll hang up now.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.839
Goodbye!

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.399
Bye!

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.239
Don't you feel so happy

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.280
after every call with her?

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.440
She's always smiling,

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.040
supporting, and encouraging us.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.160
It's so nice.

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.040
And she always

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:47.720
picks up on the very first ring.

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:49.559
So

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.519
she is always waiting for us to call.

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:55.440
That's true.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.440
I asked her to come to Jingzhou,

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.440
but she refused.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.480
I can tell

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.280
she's afraid

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.600
she'll disturb our work

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:11.359
or add to our burden.

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:16.400
So...

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.040
Yan Studio must succeed.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.559
We'll build

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:26.480
our own home in Jingzhou

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.400
so we can bring Grandma here

00:04:30.239 --> 00:04:31.400
to live with us.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.559
She can be at peace.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.679
We can make it.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.679
Careful, don't snag the fabric.

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.640
- Be careful.
- I'm being careful.

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:48.119
I'm even holding it.

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:48.799
Hurry up.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.840
Take it off.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.199
Watch the gauze.

00:04:51.239 --> 00:04:52.112
Spread your arms out.

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:53.040
Like this?

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.712
Exactly.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.319
Otherwise, it'll tear.

00:04:55.952 --> 00:04:58.416
This afternoon I'll go fetch the goods.
Call me if anything.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.200
Hello?

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.239
Our truck broke down on the road.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.080
What?

00:05:13.359 --> 00:05:14.480
Are you okay?

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:15.439
I'm fine.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.999
But if this batch can't be
put in storage on time,

00:05:19.359 --> 00:05:21.239
sale will be a mess later.

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:24.799
And we have to pay heavy late fees.

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:26.480
I called for help.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.520
They'll arrive
after three to four hours.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.040
So...

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.799
I sent you my location.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.119
Send a truck here now.

00:05:32.359 --> 00:05:32.920
Okay.

00:05:33.328 --> 00:05:33.960
Wait.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.600
Should I ask Lin and Guan to go?

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.168
No need.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.359
Stay at the office.

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:39.520
For emergencies.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.119
Understood.

00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:41.600
Take care of yourself.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.239
Hurry up.

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:47.728
Yao.

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:49.400
Mr. Shen?

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:50.879
You look panicked.

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:51.879
Did something happen?

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.160
Yan's in trouble.

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:57.160
The truck broke down on the road.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.720
You... Why are you here?

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.319
I'll move the goods. Get in the truck.

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:38.799
I'll help you.

00:06:38.799 --> 00:06:39.559
It's okay.

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:40.920
We can handle it.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.879
Come here.

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:42.720
We'll finish soon.

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:43.319
Come on.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.040
Be careful.

00:06:53.359 --> 00:06:53.999
We'll be quick.

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:55.040
Wait.

00:06:55.679 --> 00:06:56.359
Hold this for me.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:00.840

Have some water.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:48.799
Thanks.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.280
Want more?

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.319
No.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.439
You have plenty of staff.

00:10:04.799 --> 00:10:05.920
Why transport yourself?

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.839
It's our first batch.

00:10:10.599 --> 00:10:11.839
I don't want any mishaps.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.559
So

00:10:13.199 --> 00:10:14.559
I came to check.

00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:16.479
I need to check the next batch.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.120
What about you?

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.079
Got such a huge company,

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.959
and you came yourself?

00:10:28.912 --> 00:10:30.000
There's a company retreat.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.920
I called Chen Lin,

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.160
but he's not answering.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.079
So I came here myself.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.240
You really don't need to refuse

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.439
my helping you.

00:10:52.319 --> 00:10:53.400
In business world,

00:10:55.319 --> 00:10:56.760
no one succeeds

00:10:56.799 --> 00:10:57.880
without help.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.000
It's not like that.

00:11:03.559 --> 00:11:05.640
I just want to prove to myself

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.199
that I can live the life I want

00:11:11.079 --> 00:11:12.760
without relying on your resources.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.959
So if you truly care about me,

00:11:18.199 --> 00:11:20.920
don't make me lose that faith, okay?

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.479
But I drove for you

00:11:25.839 --> 00:11:27.120
and helped you move goods.

00:11:27.719 --> 00:11:28.920
That's not money power, right?

00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:31.679
If you really mind it,

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.520
maybe give me a little reward.

00:11:43.479 --> 00:11:45.719
Actually, I know why you're
working so hard now.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.000
I used to be too arrogant.

00:11:52.439 --> 00:11:54.360
I underestimated your value.

00:11:56.319 --> 00:11:57.520
But I truly hope

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.040
you can live more easily

00:12:00.799 --> 00:12:02.599
and happily.

00:12:11.559 --> 00:12:13.120
Now that I'm being true to myself,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.079
I'm much happier than before.

00:12:20.319 --> 00:12:21.079
Besides,

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.479
no job in this world isn't hard.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.799
But if the outcome brings joy,

00:12:26.799 --> 00:12:28.400
a little hardship doesn't matter.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.640
You have me.

00:12:35.319 --> 00:12:36.599
You don't understand.

00:12:36.959 --> 00:12:37.880
What I want to say is

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.959
I want my happiness to come from myself.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.040
I believe you will.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:53.280
I will.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.920
I definitely will.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:58.760
Otherwise,

00:12:58.799 --> 00:13:00.120
you wouldn't see me as I am now.

00:13:00.959 --> 00:13:04.559
And I wouldn't see you
talking to me like this, either.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.520
Keep it up.

00:13:22.384 --> 00:13:23.040
By the way,

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.160
you don't have to target Jiang Liang

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.360
so aggressively.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.479
I'm not targeting him.

00:13:29.799 --> 00:13:31.520
He's the one who wants me gone.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.360
But you both want
the best for Yan Studio, right?

00:13:39.559 --> 00:13:41.040
Do you really believe his words?

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.040
What he said isn't all wrong.

00:13:48.439 --> 00:13:49.640
But I chose your plan.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.479
Smart choice.

00:13:58.199 --> 00:13:59.520
So I want to tell you,

00:13:59.599 --> 00:14:01.240
Jiang Liang is now my investor.

00:14:02.199 --> 00:14:04.000
Don't go head-to-head with him.

00:14:06.224 --> 00:14:06.920
Fine.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.479
Sir, keep going.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.360
I've reviewed the contract.

00:14:33.439 --> 00:14:34.319
No issues.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:20.400

00:15:20.559 --> 00:15:23.040

the warehouse will unload.

is sold out!

00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:53.640
Post-sales statistics show

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:55.599
our return rate is extremely low.

00:16:55.959 --> 00:16:57.360
Customer satisfaction rate

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.319

that our second batch is launching.

00:17:05.759 --> 00:17:06.880
Five designs in total.

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:08.400
If sales go as smoothly

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.479
as the first,

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.360
we can start pre-orders online
for batch three.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.160
Qiao Lin.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.479
Tell the factory

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.920
to add another production line.

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:16.759
No problem.

00:17:16.959 --> 00:17:17.679
Add it!

00:17:17.679 --> 00:17:18.999
We are selling well!

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.040
By the way, Xiaowan.

00:17:21.719 --> 00:17:23.479
Keep developing the online marketing.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.439
We need proper warm-up
for the second batch.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.959
Don't worry, Ms. Xu.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:27.999
Ms. Xu.

00:17:27.999 --> 00:17:30.320
Some beauty brands want
product placements in our videos.

00:17:30.479 --> 00:17:32.439
Resource swaps are being finalized.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.120
Good.

00:17:33.439 --> 00:17:34.160
Keep with it.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.039
Two of our first-batch designs
sold out fast.

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:38.960
Fans who missed out
are requesting a restocking.

00:17:40.519 --> 00:17:41.479
Tally the numbers.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.039
We'll purchase more fabric

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:44.640
and add the production.

00:17:44.848 --> 00:17:45.439
Okay.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:46.920
Yao.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.920
Are the designs
for the fourth batch ready?

00:17:49.519 --> 00:17:52.160
I've sent the drawings
to the pattern makers of the factory.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.519
Before starting production,

00:17:53.519 --> 00:17:55.400
a few details need adjustment.

00:17:55.519 --> 00:17:56.439
Tell me once it's done.

00:17:56.439 --> 00:17:56.840
Okay.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.080
Lastly, Meng Zhao.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.479
Stay on after-sales,
and give feedback in time.

00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:01.160
Got it, Ms. Xu.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:01.959
Everyone.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.279
We're now gearing up

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.640
for the second batch launch.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.360
Keep the workflow tight.

00:18:08.519 --> 00:18:09.320
Keep the momentum.

00:18:10.999 --> 00:18:11.840
Let's go!

Let's go!

Let's go!

Yan!

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.920
We've got trouble!

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.840
Why does it look exactly

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.160
like our second-batch pieces?

00:19:54.279 --> 00:19:56.239
Yes. I found it on a shopping site,

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.679
saying it's from the same factory.

00:19:57.999 --> 00:19:59.279
They look the same.

00:19:59.279 --> 00:20:01.320
But look closely,
the fabrics are totally different.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.479
You noticed it, right?

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.439
They are machine-made,

00:20:04.719 --> 00:20:05.999
but our products are handmade.

00:20:06.239 --> 00:20:08.160
We price at 3,999 yuan.

00:20:08.199 --> 00:20:09.840
They sell at 399 yuan.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.999
Within just one day,

00:20:10.999 --> 00:20:11.999
they've sold hundreds.

00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:13.439
We only released 100 units total.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:14.840
This one's even cheaper.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.199
Only costs 199 yuan.

00:20:18.679 --> 00:20:19.519
What's the feedback?

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.439
Some influencer made a hit piece,
smearing us.

00:20:21.439 --> 00:20:22.199
A popular one.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.519
Similar posts and videos

00:20:39.519 --> 00:20:41.120
have appeared online.

00:20:41.719 --> 00:20:43.519
What's with this blurry footage?

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.959
Deliberately blur the details.

00:20:44.959 --> 00:20:47.120
Our actual products won't be
of such poor texture.

00:20:47.239 --> 00:20:48.959
They are misleading.

00:20:48.999 --> 00:20:50.120
There are two possibilities.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.759
Either our designs
got leaked by the factory.

00:20:52.959 --> 00:20:55.800
Or someone wants to
deliberately smear us.

00:20:56.439 --> 00:20:57.560
Guan has gone to the factory

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.560
to investigate.

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:00.840
How are the sales?

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.080
Zero orders.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:02.840
Even worse,

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.439
many people are canceling orders.

00:21:04.479 --> 00:21:07.199
First-batch buyers want returns.
Some even won't return the goods.

00:21:07.439 --> 00:21:08.640
Likely got influenced

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.719
by those bad reviews.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.920
Now our mini-program store

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.880
and video channels are
flooded with bad ratings.

00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:14.600
Ms. Xu.

00:21:15.239 --> 00:21:16.400
We went to the factory.

00:21:16.519 --> 00:21:17.968
The designs weren't leaked by them.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.200
Seeing the bad reviews online,
they're worried about the final payment.

00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:22.199
For the third batch,

00:21:22.199 --> 00:21:24.279
they demand an extra
30% deposit before production.

00:21:24.279 --> 00:21:25.519
Ms. Xu, what should we do?

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.679
(Look at its pattern and fabric)

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.679
(of the 3,999 piece.)

00:21:38.959 --> 00:21:40.439
(And of the 399 yuan piece.)

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.080
(Look at their knot buttons)

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.160
(and technique used.)

00:21:43.536 --> 00:21:44.120
(See?)

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:44.759
(Do you see?)

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:45.600
(They're identical.)

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.479
(And the patterns,)

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:48.920
(the texture,)

00:21:48.959 --> 00:21:50.679
(and the fabric quality.)

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.160
(They're exactly the same!)

00:21:54.479 --> 00:21:55.239
(Guys.)

00:21:55.519 --> 00:21:56.519
(I'm furious.)

00:21:56.679 --> 00:21:57.600
(Who can stand this?)

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:58.999
(No conscience at all!)

00:21:58.999 --> 00:21:59.640
You're here.

00:21:59.719 --> 00:22:00.479
Good.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.800
What's up?

00:22:04.679 --> 00:22:05.800
Yan Studio you invested in

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.160
is drowning in public criticism.

00:22:07.959 --> 00:22:08.959
And you're still so calm?

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.640
Prices inflated tenfold.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.920
Tricking customers.

00:22:13.959 --> 00:22:15.679
Even Yuanhang is dragged into this.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.719
Terminate the investment right away.

00:22:20.519 --> 00:22:22.360
Calm down.

00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:25.560
Are you still that
unflappable Ms. Jiang?

00:22:27.519 --> 00:22:30.519
When big influencers exposing scams,

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.479
consumers will lose their sanity easily.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:34.600
Once the heat fades,

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.840
who will care about the truth?

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.479
Yan Studio will be worthless.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.759
Cease collaboration with Yan Studio.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:42.560
Cut your losses.

00:22:53.479 --> 00:22:54.800
Don't worry.

00:22:55.239 --> 00:22:56.239
Unexpected issues

00:22:56.279 --> 00:22:58.320
always appear in business.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.039
I'll always stand by you

00:23:01.439 --> 00:23:02.479
and help you.

00:23:02.759 --> 00:23:03.536
Okay?

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.400
I just feel sorry.

00:23:10.759 --> 00:23:13.120
When Yan Studio started with nothing,

00:23:14.239 --> 00:23:15.759
when no one believed in us,

00:23:17.999 --> 00:23:18.999
you supported us.

00:23:20.439 --> 00:23:22.560
You invested and got us started.

00:23:23.719 --> 00:23:24.439
Really, thank you.

00:23:26.999 --> 00:23:27.640
So, now,

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.920
with this crisis,

00:23:31.439 --> 00:23:32.920
I won't dodge responsibility.

00:23:34.439 --> 00:23:36.160
Why?

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.239
Don't be so gloomy.

00:23:38.239 --> 00:23:39.279
I'm here eating,

00:23:39.279 --> 00:23:40.560
not blaming.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.039
You might face refunds, returns,

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.600
and production issues.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.600
So what?

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.080
I've got funds ready.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.759
Cover the deficit first.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.640
I just got Yuanhang's email.

00:24:04.679 --> 00:24:07.160
To terminate investment in Yan Studio.

00:24:09.039 --> 00:24:12.039
The investment account is frozen too.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.479
- So, Jiang Liang...
- Don't worry.

00:24:15.959 --> 00:24:17.279
That's the procedure.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.560
I can use my private funds.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.600
Rest assured.

00:24:25.239 --> 00:24:26.920
I will help you.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.120
Thank you.

00:24:31.199 --> 00:24:31.759
No need.

00:24:33.759 --> 00:24:34.519
Really, thank you.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.320
Don't mention it.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.719
You're willing to help at this moment.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.519
But...

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.320
The more you offer,

00:24:46.896 --> 00:24:48.368
the more I feel I shouldn't accept.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.439
Don't overthink it.

00:24:54.199 --> 00:24:56.239
Yuanhang Group
has already made the decision.

00:24:57.039 --> 00:24:58.600
As high-rise,

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.160
you can't go against its stance.

00:25:03.479 --> 00:25:04.720
I won't

00:25:06.352 --> 00:25:07.959
drag you down

00:25:07.959 --> 00:25:10.400
just to survive.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.320
We're friends,

00:25:18.239 --> 00:25:19.400
but this is business.

00:25:22.519 --> 00:25:23.519
They're separate matters.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.039
Besides,

00:25:34.439 --> 00:25:35.519
about your suggestion,

00:25:35.519 --> 00:25:36.800
I thought it over.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.479
Actually, Shen Haoming was right.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.759
At this stage,

00:25:42.959 --> 00:25:45.920
Yan Studio shouldn't tie
ourselves to capital.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.039
We should focus on

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.360
building our own IP matrix.

00:25:51.519 --> 00:25:52.199
I admit

00:25:54.279 --> 00:25:56.320
regarding Yan Studio's development,

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.160
his proposal was slightly better.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.759
But I think this crisis

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.600
is not totally bad.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.320
At least I know

00:26:20.479 --> 00:26:22.239
I've got you, such a great investor,

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:26.479
such a loyal friend.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:34.800
If that's the case,

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:35.800
I won't push.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.199
I respect your decision,

00:26:40.679 --> 00:26:42.160
and Yuanhang's decision too.

00:26:44.279 --> 00:26:47.759
The investment funds
are just frozen for now.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.959
After the crisis passes,

00:26:50.199 --> 00:26:51.160
I'll convince my sister.

00:26:52.759 --> 00:26:54.759
The investor spot must still be mine.

00:26:55.279 --> 00:26:55.959
No problem.

00:26:56.479 --> 00:26:57.039
You promise?

00:26:57.239 --> 00:26:57.840
I promise.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:59.080
Additionally,

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.320
let me handle public relations.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.199
My network's wider.

00:27:04.959 --> 00:27:05.560
Thanks.

00:27:18.999 --> 00:27:20.120
Actually, I quite envy you.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.479
Envy me for what?

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:26.959
For having a great investor

00:27:26.959 --> 00:27:29.080
who's got your back,

00:27:29.479 --> 00:27:32.719
also an extraordinary friend like me.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.239
How did you get so lucky?

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.320
Because I'm outstanding enough

00:27:37.959 --> 00:27:40.880
to attract a great investor.

00:27:40.999 --> 00:27:42.039
Like attracts like.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.360
Right.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:51.759
Honestly,

00:27:53.959 --> 00:27:57.959
you are the strongest girl
I've ever met.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.439
Okay.

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.999
I'm serious.

00:28:08.519 --> 00:28:09.160
I believe you.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:22.256
Everyone.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.600
Cheer up.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.600
We must face challenges head-on.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.360
Every fashion brand

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.400
encounters these issues.

00:28:31.199 --> 00:28:32.160
Nothing is impossible.

00:28:32.439 --> 00:28:33.719
Results come from action.

00:28:36.144 --> 00:28:36.719
Okay.

00:28:36.959 --> 00:28:37.679
All departments,

00:28:37.679 --> 00:28:38.959
report your current issues

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.039
for discussion, okay?

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.880
About the no-reason refund requests,

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:43.479
what to do?

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:44.800
If the clothes were bought

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.160
through official channels,

00:28:46.439 --> 00:28:47.400
refund them all.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.600
We'll cover shipping.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.519
Any pressure on finance?

00:28:50.679 --> 00:28:51.640
Unconditionally?

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.479
The first batch's sales loss
will be huge.

00:28:54.959 --> 00:28:55.679
Moreover,

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.560
the PR manager of the beauty brand
that reached us

00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.840
wants to pause collaboration.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.199
Do as they requested.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.199
It's our brand's fault this time.

00:29:07.719 --> 00:29:08.920
Comfort customers

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.039
and stay in touch.

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.400
Got it, Ms. Xu.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.400
Huanhuan.

00:29:15.999 --> 00:29:18.160
Pin the after-sales policy

00:29:18.199 --> 00:29:19.400
to the top of our store page.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.800
Don't delete comments,
but explain clearly.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.199
Take all questions and criticisms.

00:29:26.759 --> 00:29:29.120
For counterfeit shops online,

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.199
report them all

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.519
and get them taken down fast.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:32.759
Got it, Yan.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:38.880
Yao.

00:29:41.039 --> 00:29:43.360
There's a problem
with the second batch of designs.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.320
But we can't hold anyone
accountable now.

00:29:45.719 --> 00:29:46.479
Qiao Lin told me

00:29:46.479 --> 00:29:48.120
the third batch hasn't started.

00:29:48.479 --> 00:29:52.160
Can you fix the draft quickly?

00:29:53.519 --> 00:29:54.640
Keep your originals safe.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.160
Can you do it?

00:29:56.439 --> 00:29:56.959
Yes.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:57.880
Of course I can.

00:30:00.999 --> 00:30:01.560
Yan.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.239
Our funds are extremely tight now.

00:30:03.239 --> 00:30:05.719
Should we delay the third batch?

00:30:05.999 --> 00:30:06.560
Exactly.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.999
Don't forget the factory wants

00:30:07.999 --> 00:30:09.920
30% more deposit before production.

00:30:09.999 --> 00:30:10.719
Then pay it.

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.039
After Yao finalizes the designs,

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:16.400
start production.

00:30:19.344 --> 00:30:21.978
(Disappointing! Regret buying.
Overpriced trash! Yan Studio's doomed.)

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:24.479
Huanhuan.

00:30:24.959 --> 00:30:26.279
How's our online reputation?

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.600
It's a complete mess.

00:30:28.624 --> 00:30:29.360
Alright.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:30.400
Ms. Xu.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:31.600
Ms. Xu!

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:33.199
Mr. Zhang.

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:37.880
Ms. Qiao.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:39.759
Where's Ms. Xu?

00:30:40.439 --> 00:30:41.360
She isn't here today.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.199
Any problem? Let's talk inside.

00:30:43.199 --> 00:30:43.840
No, no.

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:45.904
Ms. Qiao.

00:30:46.039 --> 00:30:46.560
Well,

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.160
I've supplied your trims

00:30:48.199 --> 00:30:49.719
for a long time.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.840
Never made any mistakes, right?

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.039
So,

00:30:53.199 --> 00:30:53.999
let's cut the chase.

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.959
I'm here today for one thing.

00:30:56.439 --> 00:30:58.120
Please settle the payment now.

00:30:59.719 --> 00:31:00.439
Mr. Zhang.

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.600
The contract said
settlement's at month-end.

00:31:02.679 --> 00:31:04.160
It's still more than ten days away.

00:31:04.479 --> 00:31:06.239
You can't just show up now

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.880
asking for money.

00:31:08.199 --> 00:31:10.120
That's not it.

00:31:10.679 --> 00:31:12.840
Those fakes are everywhere.

00:31:13.199 --> 00:31:15.320
Your second batch
didn't sell at all, right?

00:31:16.279 --> 00:31:18.320
I'm afraid by month-end,

00:31:18.519 --> 00:31:20.439
your office will be empty.

00:31:20.759 --> 00:31:22.479
If this debt dies,

00:31:22.679 --> 00:31:24.759
I'm done too. Understand?

00:31:24.999 --> 00:31:25.640
Mr. Zhang.

00:31:25.959 --> 00:31:27.039
We're just having

00:31:27.039 --> 00:31:28.279
a small setback.

00:31:28.439 --> 00:31:29.640
Business is running fine.

00:31:29.679 --> 00:31:30.999
We won't escape.

00:31:31.279 --> 00:31:33.039
If you insist on settling today,

00:31:33.039 --> 00:31:34.439
you'll be breaching the contract.

00:31:34.679 --> 00:31:35.999
Then we'd have the right

00:31:35.999 --> 00:31:36.959
to demand compensation.

00:31:37.679 --> 00:31:38.239
Come on.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.519
Don't threaten me with compensation.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.439
Your business is failing.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:43.840
If you collapse,

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.039
I'm not dying with you!

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.320
- What are you talking about?
- Watch your mouth.

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:48.920
Nonsense!

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.080
What did you say?

00:31:50.719 --> 00:31:52.160
You're trying

00:31:52.239 --> 00:31:53.479
to bully me, huh?

00:31:53.999 --> 00:31:55.199
Let me tell you.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.239
My factory may be small,

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.479
but we're not pushovers.

00:31:58.519 --> 00:31:59.039
Qiao Lin.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.999
If you don't settle the payment today,

00:32:01.479 --> 00:32:03.400
think carefully about the consequences!

00:32:03.759 --> 00:32:04.400
Consequences?

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.199
Are you threatening us now?

00:32:06.239 --> 00:32:08.039
You came demanding money early.

00:32:08.039 --> 00:32:09.080
How dare you yell here?

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:09.759
Exactly!

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:10.479
Exactly!

00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:12.039
Mr. Zhang.

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.880
Our cooperation lasts a long time.

00:32:13.999 --> 00:32:15.239
What you're doing now

00:32:15.239 --> 00:32:17.039
is kicking us while we're down.

00:32:17.239 --> 00:32:17.920
Well then,

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.120
I'll be straightforward.

00:32:19.239 --> 00:32:20.999
You're not getting paid today.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.519
We'll follow the contract.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:23.920
Stop causing trouble.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:24.600
Please leave.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.600
Get out now.

00:32:26.679 --> 00:32:27.840
Or we'll call the police!

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.479
You...

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.640
Are you leaving or not?

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:30.479
Watch it!

00:32:30.479 --> 00:32:30.999
Get out!

00:32:30.999 --> 00:32:31.800
Please leave.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.160
Go.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.800
So this is your attitude?

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:35.640
Remember.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.479
You'll regret it.

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.719
Just wait and see!

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:41.999
Watch your own step!

00:32:45.439 --> 00:32:45.959
Lin.

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.400
Should we tell Yan about this?

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.519
No.

00:32:51.719 --> 00:32:53.880
She's being grilled
by the e-commerce platform today.

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.400
She's got enough on her plate.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:56.600
Let's just work.

00:32:57.279 --> 00:32:57.880
Back to work.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.279
I know.

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:03.640
About the online mess,

00:33:03.759 --> 00:33:04.920
I'll handle it properly.

00:33:04.999 --> 00:33:06.519
As stated in the meeting,

00:33:07.039 --> 00:33:08.400
if there are any issues,

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.360
Yan Studio will bear all consequences.

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.320
Don't worry.

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:11.959
Ms. Xu.

00:33:15.679 --> 00:33:16.279
Thank you.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:20.840
Long time no see.

00:33:24.199 --> 00:33:24.840
Ms. Xu.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.320
Using traditional crafts

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.719
as a brand feature

00:33:30.199 --> 00:33:31.439
really gives your brand taste.

00:33:32.759 --> 00:33:34.679
Your development pace is impressive.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:35.800
Congratulations.

00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:39.120
Thank you.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.640
But I heard

00:33:41.439 --> 00:33:42.880
before the second launch,

00:33:43.479 --> 00:33:45.080
you ran into trouble.

00:33:50.759 --> 00:33:52.519
I feel indignant for you.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.999
Your hard work gets criticized,

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.160
while cheap fakes get praise.

00:34:00.959 --> 00:34:02.400
That's unfair.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.239
If stock piles up,

00:34:07.679 --> 00:34:08.800
capital chains break,

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:10.039
investors pull out...

00:34:11.439 --> 00:34:12.159
Soon,

00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:15.400
suppliers will come demanding payments.

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.439
How will you handle that?

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:22.280
Honestly,

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.999
I don't think this issue that simple.

00:34:27.559 --> 00:34:30.320
It's hard to push a startup brand

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.880
into this position overnight.

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.840
I believe someone's behind it.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:36.639
Think carefully.

00:34:37.959 --> 00:34:39.320
Did you offend anyone?

00:34:50.079 --> 00:34:51.959
Is it a kind reminder

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.880
or a warning?

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.479
You know so much about those fakes.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.159
Were you involved?

00:35:03.039 --> 00:35:04.240
Is that why you're here?

00:35:08.159 --> 00:35:08.720
Ms. Xu.

00:35:09.439 --> 00:35:10.559
Don't make baseless claims.

00:35:11.079 --> 00:35:13.920
I'm a fan of yours,
so I care about your situations.

00:35:14.479 --> 00:35:15.599
Don't wrong me.

00:35:17.639 --> 00:35:18.256
Of course,

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:22.519
I do care whether it's Jinda or Situo

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.920
will win the deal with the Russians.

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:28.840
Help me,

00:35:29.519 --> 00:35:31.360
and I'll help you.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:35.360
How?

00:35:37.439 --> 00:35:39.920
My proposal at the resort still stands.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.119
If you can publicly announce

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.599
you and Mr. Shen are filing for divorce,

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.760
I'll solve your urgent problem.

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:51.720
5 million to your account

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.400
within an hour.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:02.559
Not interested.

00:36:02.959 --> 00:36:03.760
Is it too little?

00:36:05.159 --> 00:36:05.880
Ten million.

00:36:12.639 --> 00:36:13.479
Twenty million.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:19.519
That generous?

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.400
Aren't you afraid I'll demand more?

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.240
This is the price

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.760
for you to betray Mr. Shen.

00:36:29.999 --> 00:36:31.320
It's worth it.

00:36:31.639 --> 00:36:32.639
I don't think so.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.559
Why would I abandon

00:36:35.639 --> 00:36:37.039
Jinda Group's support

00:36:37.519 --> 00:36:38.920
for your mere 20 million?

00:36:40.079 --> 00:36:40.680
Ms. Xu.

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:42.599
Don't be so stubborn.

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.079
Aren't you afraid your trouble

00:36:45.559 --> 00:36:47.039
might spiral out of control?

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.039
I believe this won't be
my first trouble,

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.680
nor will it be the last.

00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:58.880
Right, Mr. Steve?

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.240
Ms. Xu.

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:04.639
You're young,

00:37:05.159 --> 00:37:05.760
beautiful,

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.599
decisive and fearless.

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:09.920
However,

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.639
overconfidence will bring you trouble.

00:37:14.639 --> 00:37:15.559
You're right.

00:37:17.439 --> 00:37:18.159
I'll keep that.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.880
If there's nothing else,

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.400
I need to get back to work.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.599
You can refuse me.

00:37:29.439 --> 00:37:32.559
I will give you time to think.

00:37:33.639 --> 00:37:35.280
If you change your mind, come find me.

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.959
Many problems really can't be solved

00:37:39.959 --> 00:37:40.920
without money.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:43.400
Good day.

00:37:49.816 --> 00:37:51.568
(Review Cat: Yan Studio overprices,
betraying fans' trust)

00:37:51.568 --> 00:37:53.222
(Boycott Yan Studio)

00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:58.880
Mr. Shen.

00:37:59.639 --> 00:38:01.200
This is the Q2 report.

00:38:04.632 --> 00:38:05.990
(The worst clothes I've ever bought)

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.400
Steve went to Yan Studio today.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.400
Mr. Shen.

00:38:12.959 --> 00:38:15.079
Should we help Yan?

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:16.999
Help?

00:38:18.159 --> 00:38:19.240
She won't accept it.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.680
I'll call you back later.

00:38:36.159 --> 00:38:36.760
You're so busy.

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.920
I have something to discuss with you.

00:38:40.639 --> 00:38:41.680
Is anything wrong?

00:38:42.159 --> 00:38:42.680
No.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.720
I'm here to submit my resignation.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:49.400
Now?

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:52.599
Let me be frank.

00:38:53.159 --> 00:38:55.720
I've found a great job.

00:38:56.079 --> 00:38:58.039
The title and salary are perfect.

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.880
I'm not coming tomorrow.

00:39:05.079 --> 00:39:05.680
Dong.

00:39:06.639 --> 00:39:08.320
You're our CFO.

00:39:09.039 --> 00:39:12.680
You handle all the accounts.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.360
Yes.

00:39:13.519 --> 00:39:15.200
Also, the communication with suppliers.

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.479
If you leave tomorrow,

00:39:18.519 --> 00:39:19.720
who can take over?

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:22.559
Ms. Xu.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.240
I'm really sorry.

00:39:24.999 --> 00:39:26.959
But this opportunity matters too much.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.079
They require me to start right away
or they'll choose someone else.

00:39:30.639 --> 00:39:32.280
You know how hard

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.320
good jobs are to get.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.559
I don't want to miss this chance.

00:39:43.039 --> 00:39:44.360
Do you have any demand

00:39:46.559 --> 00:39:47.559
about the current salary?

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:51.320
Ms. Xu.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.959
I know our books better than anyone.

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.920
What's the point of asking?

00:39:57.639 --> 00:39:59.639
With the remaining funds,

00:39:59.959 --> 00:40:00.920
our company

00:40:01.039 --> 00:40:02.400
can't even last a month.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.464
Please don't make things hard.

00:40:04.959 --> 00:40:05.880
We all know the things.

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:06.999
Just let me go.

00:40:06.999 --> 00:40:07.920
I can let you go.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:10.479
No problem.

00:40:10.999 --> 00:40:14.119
But the labor contract states clearly.

00:40:14.959 --> 00:40:16.400
Financial positions are special.

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.400
Resignation requires one month's notice.

00:40:19.599 --> 00:40:21.159
Finish the handover,

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:22.999
and then you can leave.

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:24.559
Understood?

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.400
Lin Tao?

00:40:31.039 --> 00:40:31.559
Lin.

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:34.999
Why are you here?

00:40:36.656 --> 00:40:37.904
Before going back to hometown,

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.760
I brought some stuff for you and Yan.

00:40:40.119 --> 00:40:42.360
I made a scene at her workplace

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.320
but didn't apologize.

00:40:45.159 --> 00:40:46.760
Now that I'm leaving Jingzhou,

00:40:46.999 --> 00:40:48.119
I wanted to settle this.

00:40:48.559 --> 00:40:49.959
Otherwise, I'd feel guilty.

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.360
Yan isn't that petty.

00:40:52.439 --> 00:40:53.479
She's long forgotten.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:54.479
Well, Ms. Xu.

00:40:54.479 --> 00:40:55.999
Don't go too far.

00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.200
You only care about your company.

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.159
Have you thought how others live?

00:41:01.479 --> 00:41:03.999
You want me to stay
till your company shuts down?

00:41:04.559 --> 00:41:05.880
At that time,

00:41:06.519 --> 00:41:08.039
with a blemished resume,

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.599
how can I find a job?

00:41:10.959 --> 00:41:12.720
I know labor laws!

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.200
I'll pay the penalty.

00:41:15.056 --> 00:41:15.888
Well,

00:41:16.079 --> 00:41:17.159
wait a moment.

00:41:17.599 --> 00:41:19.079
Who are you?

00:41:19.312 --> 00:41:20.079
Well,

00:41:20.559 --> 00:41:21.760
it doesn't matter.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.039
I heard what you just said.

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:25.920
As CFO,

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.599
you must complete

00:41:27.599 --> 00:41:29.159
handover procedures before leaving.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:33.159
You must ensure financial operations'
continuity and stability.

00:41:33.959 --> 00:41:35.079
Resigning without handover

00:41:35.439 --> 00:41:37.079
may violate financial discipline

00:41:37.159 --> 00:41:37.999
and accounting rules.

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:39.400
It's illegal.

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.119
You know that, right?

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:42.840
Fine.

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.519
I'll hand over this mess.

00:41:45.999 --> 00:41:46.720
You dare take it?

00:41:47.519 --> 00:41:48.999
Why not?

00:41:49.599 --> 00:41:51.240
But don't think leaving

00:41:51.559 --> 00:41:53.320
clears you of responsibility.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:56.559
You must ensure all transferred ledgers,

00:41:56.599 --> 00:41:58.360
reports, and related documents

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:00.639
are complete and error-free.

00:42:00.959 --> 00:42:04.599
Guarantee the legality and authenticity.

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.240
You're legally liable.

00:42:07.079 --> 00:42:08.880
If you don't mind me
informing your next boss,

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.720
then fine.

00:42:15.999 --> 00:42:16.680
Okay.

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:17.720
I'll do the handover.

00:42:18.639 --> 00:42:20.039
But let me make it clear.

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.519
My time is limited.

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.119
I'm giving you just two days.

00:42:23.439 --> 00:42:24.079
Ms. Xu.

00:42:24.519 --> 00:42:25.720
Find someone experienced

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:27.119
to take over.

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:28.920
I won't wait long.

00:42:29.039 --> 00:42:29.840
What a coincidence.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:32.840
I'm Bachelor in accounting,

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.680
Master in finance,

00:42:35.039 --> 00:42:36.200
and certified accountant.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:38.800
You've messed
with the wrong person this time.

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:40.439
Let's start now.

00:42:40.959 --> 00:42:42.320
If there's a single slip,

00:42:42.519 --> 00:42:43.360
you're not leaving.

00:42:51.119 --> 00:42:51.720
Ms. Xu.

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:53.456
Ms. Qiao.

00:42:53.599 --> 00:42:54.599
If you trust me,

00:42:55.119 --> 00:42:56.599
let me handle the financial handover.

00:43:00.439 --> 00:43:01.920
Alright.

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.760
The office's on the second floor.

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:05.840
Thank you.

00:43:07.079 --> 00:43:07.959
Thanks, Lin Tao.

00:43:07.999 --> 00:43:08.559
No problem.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:12.959
Why is he here?

00:43:13.519 --> 00:43:15.959
He said he did something improper,

00:43:15.959 --> 00:43:17.159
so he came to apologize.

00:43:18.479 --> 00:43:18.999
That's all?

00:43:51.999 --> 00:43:52.559
Yao.

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.479
Have the journals and ledgers
been sorted out?

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:56.959
Yes.

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.360
Here.

00:44:00.159 --> 00:44:00.800
Thank you.

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:04.912
Ms. Qiao.

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:06.240
Ms. Qiao.

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:07.920
I made you instant noodles.

00:44:08.439 --> 00:44:09.040
Thanks.

00:44:09.599 --> 00:44:10.640
How much is left?

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.872
When the journals and ledgers all done,
I'll go over it again.

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:15.720
Go home now.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:16.519
Do it tomorrow.

00:44:17.439 --> 00:44:17.999
It's okay.

00:44:19.119 --> 00:44:21.039
The books are a mess now.

00:44:21.639 --> 00:44:22.959
He's in such a rush to quit,

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:24.360
even willing to pay.

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.039
Maybe something's fishy.

00:44:27.079 --> 00:44:28.360
Better to clear it up fast.

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:31.639
By the way,

00:44:32.519 --> 00:44:34.159
there's something you and Xu Yan

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.280
should be aware of.

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:37.920
There is all outflow,

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.200
no income this month.

00:44:39.479 --> 00:44:41.999
I think one month later...

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.159
Alright, I see.

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:48.880
Thank you for your help this time.

00:44:49.559 --> 00:44:50.680
No need.

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.360
We're all working outside.

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.720
Call me if you need anything.

00:44:53.959 --> 00:44:54.512
Okay.

00:44:54.512 --> 00:44:55.120
Keep it up.

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:55.840
I'm leaving.

00:44:55.999 --> 00:44:56.528
Alright.

00:44:59.959 --> 00:45:00.639
Mrs. Baraikin.

00:45:01.079 --> 00:45:02.320
Satisfied with this room?

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:04.039
Yes.

00:45:04.479 --> 00:45:06.280
Mr. Shen, you're so considerate.

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:07.360
Have a seat.

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:08.048
Alright.

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:12.079
Mr. Baraikin and I
feel like old friends.

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:14.880
We agreed if you came to Jingzhou,

00:45:15.039 --> 00:45:16.439
I'd treat you well.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.240
Indeed. Today, he was supposed to come

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:20.720
but got assigned other tasks

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.280
after landing.

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:23.400
That's okay.

00:45:24.039 --> 00:45:26.680
I'll adjust my schedule for him.

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:29.400
By the way, Yan truly misses you.

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:31.400
Where is she?

00:45:32.079 --> 00:45:34.479
I planned to bring her here,

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.360
but her company ran into some troubles.

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:38.880
So I didn't bring her.

00:45:39.559 --> 00:45:40.400
What troubles?

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:41.840
Can I help?

00:45:41.959 --> 00:45:43.920
Inform Huanhuan and Meng Zhao.

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.840
The online buzz needs control.

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:46.480
Of course.

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:47.360
Ms. Xu.

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:49.280
I've been waiting for you.

00:45:49.999 --> 00:45:50.880
Mr. Liu.

00:45:52.039 --> 00:45:52.720
Mr. Zhang.

00:45:53.079 --> 00:45:53.720
Mr. Zhao.

00:45:54.479 --> 00:45:55.479
What brings you here?

00:45:56.039 --> 00:45:56.599
Ms. Xu.

00:45:57.439 --> 00:45:58.439
Last time when I came,

00:45:58.639 --> 00:45:59.320
you weren't here.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:00.680
Then what?

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:01.760
Your colleague,

00:46:02.159 --> 00:46:04.320
Ms. Qiao chased me away.

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.999
It wasn't the due date,
but they came for payment.

00:46:07.039 --> 00:46:09.639
Let's have some good tea and talk, okay?

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:10.559
This way.

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.160
Prepare some great tea.

00:46:19.999 --> 00:46:20.760
Ms. Xu.

00:46:21.599 --> 00:46:24.039
Last time, Mr. Zhang
came to collect payment,

00:46:24.599 --> 00:46:26.439
but your young staff scolded him away.

00:46:28.439 --> 00:46:29.119
Rest assured.

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:30.400
we're not here

00:46:30.519 --> 00:46:31.479
to cause trouble today.

00:46:31.639 --> 00:46:32.159
Look.

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:32.880
Today,

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.079
the production team,

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:35.559
material suppliers,

00:46:35.999 --> 00:46:37.439
and logistics partners are all here.

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:39.479
We just want to ask

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:42.360
will you still produce the third batch

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:43.959
as plan?

00:46:44.079 --> 00:46:45.360
Of course we will.

00:46:46.559 --> 00:46:47.360
Mr. Zhang.

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:48.840
I'm sorry

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.999
about last time.

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:53.360
We've had a lot on our plate.

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:56.039
We've completed the revised designs

00:46:56.039 --> 00:46:56.800
for that batch.

00:46:57.079 --> 00:46:58.360
We're re-sampling

00:46:59.119 --> 00:47:01.280
and redoing the packaging.

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.240
I see.

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:04.479
Well,

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:05.936
okay.

00:47:06.639 --> 00:47:07.999
But we have one condition.

00:47:08.639 --> 00:47:09.519
For the three sectors

00:47:10.039 --> 00:47:11.519
we are handling,

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.840
the deposit goes up by 10%.

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:15.920
Right.

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:28.760
Alright.

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:30.320
No problem.

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:32.920
See?

00:47:33.119 --> 00:47:34.920
She's got funds.

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:36.639
Ms. Xu.

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:38.519
We know you're married

00:47:38.639 --> 00:47:40.079
to Mr. Shen from Jinda Group.

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.920
This is pocket change to you.

00:47:43.599 --> 00:47:44.959
We're small business owners.

00:47:45.039 --> 00:47:46.079
We can't afford delays.

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:47.439
So...

00:47:47.519 --> 00:47:49.599
If you want to keep working with us,

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:53.200
pay the final payment

00:47:53.599 --> 00:47:54.639
for the second batch too.

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.039
Mr. Liu.

00:47:56.439 --> 00:47:57.840
The second batch

00:47:58.280 --> 00:47:59.680
isn't due yet.

00:48:00.439 --> 00:48:04.400
Now our sales have been rough.

00:48:05.119 --> 00:48:07.880
Funds are currently tight.

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:09.400
Then...

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:11.999
Ask your husband.

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.320
This is nothing

00:48:14.519 --> 00:48:15.880
for Jinda Group.

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:21.360
My company has nothing to do
with Jinda Group.

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:28.559
Ms. Xu.

00:48:29.479 --> 00:48:30.559
We're all businesspeople.

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:31.760
Business is business.

00:48:32.959 --> 00:48:34.280
Given the situation now,

00:48:34.559 --> 00:48:35.999
we can't trust you.

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.439
No payment today,

00:48:39.159 --> 00:48:40.639
we'll terminate the contract.

00:48:41.559 --> 00:48:43.039
That's true.

00:48:43.159 --> 00:48:44.079
See? I've told you!

00:48:44.559 --> 00:48:46.559
They're broke!

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.240
Xu Yan,

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.559
all your assets

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:52.039
are frozen, right?

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:53.320
Who told you that?

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:54.920
Don't spread rumors, okay?

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.200
Me? Spreading rumors?

00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:58.840
Everyone has heard.

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.360
Go ask anyone.

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:01.880
Exactly.

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:03.280
Empty words won't work.

00:49:03.599 --> 00:49:05.079
We want money.

00:49:05.519 --> 00:49:07.200
You can't even pay the final payment

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.400
but claim you're fine?

00:49:08.519 --> 00:49:09.479
Who'd believe that?

00:49:10.119 --> 00:49:10.760
Ms. Xu.

00:49:11.159 --> 00:49:12.200
I have only one request.

00:49:12.599 --> 00:49:15.999
Show us what you've got right now.

00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:17.800
And we'll let it go.

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:18.680
No problem.

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:20.599
But I have one condition.

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.639
Once you receive the payment,

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:25.240
Yan Studio will permanently
cease cooperation with you.
