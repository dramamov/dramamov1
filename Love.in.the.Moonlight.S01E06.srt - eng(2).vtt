"Love in the Moonlight"
(Episode 6)

00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:21.080
You came all the way to give me the invitation

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.200
to Prince Saenkaew's wedding.
Of course, I'll attend the event.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.280
We're so honored for you to attend.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.921
You need to thank him, Saenkaew.

00:01:35.877 --> 00:01:36.878
Thank you.

00:01:40.837 --> 00:01:42.280
I think I should go.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.560
- I don't want to trouble you any longer.
- Sure.

00:01:48.777 --> 00:01:49.720
Congrats.

00:01:51.337 --> 00:01:52.338
Congrats.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.960
Sir? What happened to Prince Saenkaew
was not like this. Actually…

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.681
I know.

00:02:12.037 --> 00:02:13.560
I know that he doesn't want to get married.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.200
You told me already.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.640
But Prince Kamfah visited me like this.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.610
I can't interfere with anything.

00:02:27.537 --> 00:02:29.123
I feel bad for him.

00:02:29.477 --> 00:02:31.600
He's a good guy and he's honest.

00:02:31.903 --> 00:02:33.640
He just wanted to save his family

00:02:33.717 --> 00:02:35.800
without having to marry someone he doesn't love.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.281
Songsawat,

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.721
a life of someone like him

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.040
will get more complicated when his title gets higher.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.080
There're so many rules of living his life.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.000
His duties sometimes need to come first,

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.780
even before his own heart.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.481
You think that asking help from the Field Marshal
about transferring assets

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.640
will end everything?

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.840
I just wanted to find better way than getting married.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.880
I don't want to marry to her.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.640
I don't want to be a selfish person and used her.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.920
Nobody is using anybody in this marriage.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.600
Her dad and I

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.400
agreed on something for us to survive.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.800
If there's a better way than marriage,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.361
why don't we try it?

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.120
Why do we need Pin to be involved with this?

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.880
Let me be in hell all by myself.

00:03:46.963 --> 00:03:49.120
Why do you have to drag others to be in hell with me?

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.920
You think it's a good idea to involve

00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:58.080
a powerful person like the Field Marshal into this?

00:03:58.802 --> 00:04:00.840
You were about to cause troubles

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.960
among two nations, coming from this marriage.

00:04:04.623 --> 00:04:06.320
If there was a mistake,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.400
can you handle that?

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.120
We're not gonna talk about this anymore.

00:04:22.857 --> 00:04:24.720
You need to prepare to marry Pin-anong.

00:04:44.163 --> 00:04:48.720
What? Prince Saenkaew wanted to meet the Field Marshal

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.800
because you wanted to ask him to preside over the reception?

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.481
Wow!

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.200
Our event will be so popular.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.200
It's gonna be all over Bangkok

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.183
nope, Thailand.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.640
Pin?

00:05:08.097 --> 00:05:10.440
I brought jewelry sets from Saenkaew's mom,
so many of them.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.960
You should try to see
which one is suitable for your wedding gown.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.160
Dueanpradap, Saenkaew's mom,

00:05:19.263 --> 00:05:21.880
owned so many beautiful pieces,

00:05:22.137 --> 00:05:26.000
including rubies and emeralds. I'll show them to you.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.961
Thank you so much.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.920
- But…
- Pin, honey.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.600
They gave you gifts, you need to accept it.

00:05:38.943 --> 00:05:40.920
It's Chansaeng's tradition.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.680
Right?

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.601
That's right.

00:05:48.663 --> 00:05:53.120
Please filter your guests first.

00:05:53.683 --> 00:05:56.960
I'm afraid that someone like Prince Inthorn

00:05:57.463 --> 00:05:58.480
would show up.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.360
I don't want to be humiliated again.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.480
I'm sorry

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.200
that my brother caused some dramas earlier.

00:06:10.057 --> 00:06:12.000
I promise you that it won't happen again.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.720
But I thought you should be familiar

00:06:17.597 --> 00:06:19.440
with humiliation already.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.240
Why should I?

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.800
I heard that you visited

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.120
pawnshops all the time to pawn your vintage items.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.850
People talked about it all the way to Chansaeng.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.000
So I thought you'd be familiar with it.

00:06:51.637 --> 00:06:55.160
Welcome to our little place.

00:07:01.697 --> 00:07:05.800
He has no land to live and he still has that big mouth.

00:07:07.263 --> 00:07:09.800
You should keep it to yourself.

00:07:10.064 --> 00:07:11.280
Can you stop stirring things up?

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.321
If he calls off the wedding, we will be in trouble.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.521
Right now

00:07:16.057 --> 00:07:19.900
our creditors are waiting in line to get their money back.

00:07:23.903 --> 00:07:27.440
How could Prince Inthorn fool us like that?

00:07:28.683 --> 00:07:31.680
They're not good people to hang out with.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.960
I think this rumor could be true.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.720
You still believe Prince Inthorn?

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.040
But I felt like this father and son have something to hide.

00:08:14.137 --> 00:08:15.138
Saenkaew?

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.160
How was it? You met the Field Marshal, didn't you?

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.121
That's right.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.720
What did he say? Did he agree to help you?

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.960
What was it? Is he gonna help you?

00:08:42.817 --> 00:08:44.840
- What's going on?
- What're you doing here, Saenkaew?

00:08:45.543 --> 00:08:46.544
Dad?

00:08:50.383 --> 00:08:51.645
I mean…

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.000
I couldn't sleep so I came out here to get some fresh air.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.521
Is he your dad?

00:09:04.717 --> 00:09:05.718
Good evening, sir.

00:09:07.703 --> 00:09:10.400
This is Sasin, Pin's cousin.

00:09:11.623 --> 00:09:12.960
I think it's getting late.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.840
You should go back to your room.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:17.771
Okay.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:20.920
Wait.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.123
I need to talk to him.

00:09:26.877 --> 00:09:30.480
It's late, let's talk tomorrow.

00:09:59.843 --> 00:10:00.844
I'm closing the door.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.080
Nual, where're they heading to?

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.160
I heard that they're looking for elderly's gifts for the wedding.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.291
The wedding?

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.840
Why is there a wedding?

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.200
Why did you ask about Sasin all of a sudden?

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.920
I want to know if he's close to Saenkaew.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.521
Well…

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:48.000
Sasin is an older cousin of Pin.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.361
He is taking care of Pin

00:10:51.503 --> 00:10:54.280
so he hangs out with Prince Saenkaew as well.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.480
They're not very close.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.961
Is it true?

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.001
About Sasin and your son?

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.200
Just like what Homthip said.

00:11:16.783 --> 00:11:17.784
They have different lifestyles.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.440
Prince Saenkaew only hangs out with Sasin with Pin is around.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:36.171
Kamsu.

00:11:39.097 --> 00:11:40.160
Thank you

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.900
for not telling him about Sasin.

00:11:44.677 --> 00:11:48.240
If Prince Kamfah finds out that they're so close,
it will be a trouble.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.440
I don't want to see Prince Saenkaew in trouble.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.680
The wedding is right around the corner,
things will get better.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.760
Let me ask you something.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.560
You've never felt bad for him at least once?

00:12:03.097 --> 00:12:04.098
Homthip?

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.880
I've seen him since he was little.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.160
Of course I want to see him happy as much as you do.

00:12:13.117 --> 00:12:15.840
As a son of Prince Kamfah,

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.960
he needs to sacrifice something.

00:12:27.863 --> 00:12:31.880
This one is not too bright, it's the right choice for elderly.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.900
- This one is pretty.
- Nice color.

00:12:36.157 --> 00:12:37.280
I can't choose.

00:12:39.983 --> 00:12:44.000
Saenkaew, which one do you think?

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.161
It's up to you.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:48.637
How could it be up to me?

00:12:48.777 --> 00:12:50.320
It's our wedding.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.751
Well, the top one is fine.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.320
Saenkaew, can you look in the car for me?

00:13:11.621 --> 00:13:13.680
I think I forgot my inhaler in there.

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.600
- Sure, Grandma.
- Okay.

00:13:28.803 --> 00:13:30.320
Is something wrong?

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.880
Are you feeling okay?

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.040
You don't look so alive today.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:37.841
It's nothing.

00:13:40.254 --> 00:13:43.000
I just feel like when the wedding is

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.040
getting closer, Saenkaew looks like
he worries about something.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.440
- It's like he doesn't want to get married.
- You're overthinking it.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.941
What could be a reason for

00:13:55.041 --> 00:13:57.000
him not to marry you?

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.480
I don't know. I just feel like

00:14:00.881 --> 00:14:02.360
I make him feel uncomfortable.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:07.080
Marriage is a huge deal in life.

00:14:09.383 --> 00:14:11.520
Saenkaew is a serious man.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.800
He could be worried if the wedding'd turn out great

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:18.800
or his life after marriage

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.920
could go exactly as he expected.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.120
There're so many to things about in his head.

00:14:28.263 --> 00:14:30.360
- You think so?
- Yes.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.240
But I believe that

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.080
both of you will be happy.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.240
You just have to trust each other

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.480
and hold hands

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.600
no matter what happens, you'll get through this.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.520
Here's your inhaler.

00:14:56.243 --> 00:14:57.160
Let me help you with that.

00:15:02.277 --> 00:15:03.278
Should we go?

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.000
Sasin! This is huge! Why did you tell me?

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.160
- About what?
- Don't act so innocent.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.161
About Pin's wedding.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.480
The Field Marshal will attend the wedding.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.681
Big wedding of the year.
The Field Marshal will preside over the wedding of

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.510
Prince Saenkaew Na Chansaeng
and ML. Pin-anong Sirichalalai.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:45.761
Is Saenkaew back?

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.041
I have something to talk to him.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:51.760
I don't think you should make
Prince Saenkaew worry about anything.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.520
My cousin should be the one to worry about it.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.160
Get out of the way, I need to talk to him.

00:16:06.063 --> 00:16:07.320
What do you want to talk to him about?

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:12.200
I can pass the message on.

00:16:13.657 --> 00:16:16.560
I'll recite every single one of your word.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.320
I want to ask him

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.120
why did the Field Marshal agree to
preside over his wedding?

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.121
Saenkaew told me that
he went to see him about assets storage

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.560
so he could call off the wedding.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.377
You know about this?

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:32.200
He told me everything

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.760
including the fact that
he was forced to marry and he didn't love Pin

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:40.040
- and he will never love her.
- You got it all wrong.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.240
Saenkaew loves Pin-anong

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.000
and they will get married.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.000
He has never planned to call off the wedding.

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:52.200
Not true. I'm talking to him. Where is he?

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.400
- Saenkaew?
- What're you doing?

00:16:57.481 --> 00:16:59.030
Saenkaew!

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:01.571
Let me go!

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:03.680
- Saenkaew!
- Stop that, Kamsu!

00:17:04.463 --> 00:17:05.640
What's going on?

00:17:08.103 --> 00:17:09.770
Go back to your room!

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.601
I said go back to your room! Come on!

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.160
What happened?

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.360
Why did Kamsu need to hurt Sasin?

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.481
What happened?

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.120
What happened earlier?

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.480
Why did you fight Prince Kamfah's guy?

00:18:02.517 --> 00:18:05.240
I need to be honest with you.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.640
Saenkaew doesn't love Pin.
He doesn't want to get married.

00:18:09.037 --> 00:18:10.038
What?

00:18:10.737 --> 00:18:11.760
He told me that.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.000
Did you tell Pin about this?

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.761
I didn't.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.640
Do you know why he didn't want to get married?

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.481
I have no idea. But if he doesn't want to,
we shouldn't force him.

00:18:28.577 --> 00:18:29.360
I feel bad for Pin.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:31.440
I'll handle this.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.880
But you can't tell Pin about this, ever. You hear me?

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.840
Why didn't Saenkaew want to get married?

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.960
He didn't like that Pin's mom was a cook?

00:18:55.281 --> 00:18:58.880
- I have no idea.
- What should we do next?

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.320
He didn't want to get married,
so he needs to get married.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.760
What's on your mind?

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.960
You need to punish Kamsu for what he did today.

00:19:21.641 --> 00:19:23.120
I don't know what got into him.

00:19:23.442 --> 00:19:26.240
He only focused to pick on Sasin.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.200
Are they close? Sasin and Saenkaew?

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.400
That's right, since Saenkaew has lived here.

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:36.840
Sasin is his friend.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.880
They went out and hung out so often.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.600
Saenkaew must like Sasin so much.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.400
Sasin is a good guy.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.280
Since Saenkaew has been friend with him,

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.960
he has changed a lot, he looks so lively

00:19:58.097 --> 00:19:59.320
and so happy.

00:20:00.137 --> 00:20:02.720
I haven't seen him like this for such a long time

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.840
since his mom passed away.

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:12.920
Sasin is also reliable.

00:20:13.617 --> 00:20:16.720
Saenkaew went outside one night and

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:21.920
he got sick. Good thing Sasin helped him that night.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:24.480
They spent a night at Sasin's friend's house.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.401
Saenkaew used to spend a night with Sasin.

00:20:32.143 --> 00:20:34.482
Yeah, what's wrong?

00:20:51.623 --> 00:20:52.624
Hey!

00:20:54.777 --> 00:20:55.778
Hey!

00:21:00.603 --> 00:21:02.320
What? What's going on?

00:21:11.017 --> 00:21:13.560
Why did you climb up here? What is it?

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.440
We need to talk.

00:21:16.617 --> 00:21:17.618
Come here.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.000
You should leave.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.801
If my dad sees you here, it will be a big trouble.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:26.280
- Come on.
- Nope. We need to talk.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.640
Did you go to see the Field Marshal?

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.857
What did you say to him?
Why did it turn out to be like this?

00:21:33.563 --> 00:21:36.200
I was gonna ask him to store my assets like I told you

00:21:36.557 --> 00:21:39.560
- but…
- Saenkaew! Open the door!

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:42.720
You need to hide under the bed. Come on.

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:44.440
- Why do I need to hide?
- Hurry up, please.

00:21:49.823 --> 00:21:51.000
I told you to open the door!

00:22:04.163 --> 00:22:05.000
What are you doing?

00:22:09.443 --> 00:22:12.200
I was in the shower. What's going on?

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:15.680
What's the deal with you and Sasin?

00:22:18.197 --> 00:22:21.320
It's nothing. He's a close relative to Pin.

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.240
What about when you spent the night with him?

00:22:30.163 --> 00:22:31.764
I went out that night to run some errands.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.000
I had a fever and I passed out by the street.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.840
He saw me so he took me to his friend's house. That's it.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.400
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I am.

00:22:41.957 --> 00:22:43.200
Is it because of Sasin?

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.520
That's why you changed your mind
about marrying Pin-anong.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.521
This has gone too far.

00:22:50.897 --> 00:22:53.280
I don't want to get married because I don't love her.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:54.880
It has nothing to do with Sasin.

00:23:12.263 --> 00:23:13.264
What's this?

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.680
It's a button from my shirt.

00:23:27.361 --> 00:23:30.320
- I'll have Thip fix it for me.
- Why are you so nervous?

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:35.171
Nothing.

00:23:35.683 --> 00:23:38.360
If you don't like Sasin,

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.201
then I won't hang out with him again, okay?

00:23:56.523 --> 00:23:57.524
Dad!

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:07.231
It's enough!

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.640
I'm gonna tell Pin about canceling the wedding.

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.600
- I can't take it anymore.
- Where are you going?

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:17.440
You asked me about how I felt about her.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.680
I'm gonna tell her that I don't love her.

00:25:01.777 --> 00:25:03.480
I just want to do the right thing.

00:25:05.897 --> 00:25:08.560
It has never been right since you were born this way.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.760
What you are

00:25:16.037 --> 00:25:17.680
will ruin reputation

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.560
and bring sorrow to you and people around you.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.560
I used to believe that way

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:34.880
until I met so many people

00:25:36.517 --> 00:25:38.600
who have lived their lives the way they wanted.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.280
They seem happy with themselves.

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:49.320
I can't help but think

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.040
that I feel ashamed of myself

00:25:53.977 --> 00:25:57.240
- and unhappy because of you.
- Saenkaew!

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.440
Saenkaew?

00:26:03.721 --> 00:26:04.840
Saenkaew?

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:09.761
What's going on?

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:14.280
Grandma asked me to find you.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.000
She wanted you to help pick out jewelry set

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:18.840
that I should wear for the wedding.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.560
He's not feeling well. I'll help you with that.

00:26:44.643 --> 00:26:46.383
Are you okay?

00:26:47.403 --> 00:26:48.760
- Let me see.
- You should go.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.880
Why did your dad say that

00:26:55.943 --> 00:26:57.560
you changed your mind because of me?

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.520
He tried to find the cause, you don't need to care about it.

00:27:04.057 --> 00:27:06.760
How could I not care about it? This is about me.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.801
And he scolded you

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.441
why did he say that you would ruin his reputation?

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.800
- You?
- Hey!

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.161
I beg of you.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.160
I can't take it anymore.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.720
Can we talk later?

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:34.411
Okay.

00:27:35.357 --> 00:27:37.880
You should rest.

00:28:40.803 --> 00:28:41.804
What is this?

00:28:55.217 --> 00:28:57.920
Newspaper said that the Field Marshal will preside over

00:28:58.003 --> 00:29:00.440
the wedding reception of Saenkaew and ML. Pin-anong.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.200
You told me that they were gonna ask him

00:29:03.237 --> 00:29:04.760
to store their assets to avoid marriage.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.080
I don't know how it turned out this way.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.440
But it's a good thing.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.560
We don't have to try to stop the Field Marshal

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.760
from storing assets from my brother.

00:29:16.937 --> 00:29:18.200
How could it be a good thing?

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:21.040
He is getting married and his assets will be transferred.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.241
Think about it.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:29.080
I mean we only have to deal with my brother,

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.280
not with the Field Marshal.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.560
You need to stop the wedding.

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:38.360
So I can seize their assets.

00:29:39.463 --> 00:29:40.464
Got it.

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:54.400
Your bags will be kept in the small car

00:29:54.491 --> 00:29:55.920
and the ones behind will be kept in the big one.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.401
Pin?

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:07.400
Where are you heading to?

00:30:08.231 --> 00:30:09.320
To Hua Hin.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.320
Where're your bags?

00:30:12.523 --> 00:30:14.397
Hua Hin? I have no idea.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.160
Nobody told you?

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:20.160
You need to pack your bags, so we can go on vacation.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.200
Sasin won't join us.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:25.680
Why's that?

00:30:26.521 --> 00:30:29.600
I have something to talk to Prince Kamfah.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.120
It's better for him to stay home.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.160
Take care of the house, okay?

00:30:34.163 --> 00:30:35.164
Let's go.

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:03.411
Welcome.

00:31:09.283 --> 00:31:10.600
Homthip, Kamsu.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:13.320
Follow Nual and Jin upstairs,

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:16.160
- I told them what rooms to stay in.
- Okay.

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:19.801
Welcome.

00:31:22.223 --> 00:31:25.400
I rebuilt this place

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:30.520
and they said that this is the most modern

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.481
vacation house of this age.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.080
This is a really cozy place.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.480
You should go upstairs to rest.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.120
We were in the car for so long, you could get tired.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.241
That's right.

00:31:44.841 --> 00:31:48.160
This way, I'll take you.

00:31:51.157 --> 00:31:52.158
Honey,

00:31:52.697 --> 00:31:54.800
why don't you take Saenkaew to the guest house.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.680
I told someone to arrange a room already.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.781
Okay.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.680
We should walk by the beach and swim in the sea.

00:32:11.977 --> 00:32:14.560
It's so nice here.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.440
I'm sure you're gonna love it.

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:19.720
During school breaks,

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:22.320
Sasin and I used to stay here for months.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.560
You should ask Thip to accompany you.

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.840
I have a bad headache from a car ride.

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.280
I'm gonna take a pill and rest for a bit.

00:32:33.441 --> 00:32:34.480
I'll follow you.

00:33:00.463 --> 00:33:03.560
Get changed and hang out with Pin.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.640
Or she's gonna think
that you don't want to marry her.

00:33:10.217 --> 00:33:11.680
Well, she got that right.

00:33:11.983 --> 00:33:12.984
You!

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.761
You need to hang out with her
and work on your attitude.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.120
Do you need Sasin to come here?

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.057
- To light up your mood?
- Dad?

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.800
I told you that we're just friends.

00:33:32.917 --> 00:33:34.240
There's nothing more.

00:33:35.503 --> 00:33:37.320
I really hope so.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.880
If there's something more, I don't know how to react.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.480
He is a man

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:48.880
and he is also a cousin of your future bride.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.360
It's so wrong in many levels, so humiliating.

00:34:20.083 --> 00:34:22.800
The weather is so nice, not too hot.

00:34:24.797 --> 00:34:25.798
Right.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.160
Is everything okay?

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.641
You don't look so happy.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:34.920
You don't want to be here?

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.600
It's not like that.

00:34:40.121 --> 00:34:43.520
I think you act like something is bothering you lately.

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:47.520
You worry about the wedding, don't you?

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.281
Pin?

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.440
- I think our wedding…
- It's fine.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.880
I understand.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.761
Grandma said that marriage is a huge deal in our life.

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.480
You could be worried.

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.320
If you and I trust in each other,

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:13.760
then we will be happy.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.120
Aunt Homthip, please wait for me.

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:41.700
Get them to the table when they're cooked.

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:51.560
The weather here is really nice.

00:35:51.917 --> 00:35:52.918
Right.

00:35:53.917 --> 00:35:55.840
I'm glad you like it.

00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:01.760
Why don't you take a walk on the beach with them?

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:05.320
Let them hang out with Homthip.

00:36:05.601 --> 00:36:07.202
I'm fine right here.

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:11.280
Should we build this one?

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.520
You mean a sand castle? Sure.

00:36:50.843 --> 00:36:52.640
How did you get here?

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.360
I took a train, it's not to far from Bangkok.

00:36:57.643 --> 00:36:58.644
Why did you follow me here?

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:02.960
I'm worried about you.

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.520
Did your dad abuse you again?

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:11.531
Nope.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.001
I'm glad there's no scar.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.441
Is it hurt?

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:37.601
Not anymore.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.520
Sasin?

00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.300
You followed us here?

00:37:59.883 --> 00:38:02.000
Good. Where's your bag?

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:03.400
Did you leave it in the house?

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.960
It's okay. I can find a place to stay.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.161
Why don't you stay with us?

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.680
You know that I just had a fight with Kamsu.

00:38:14.397 --> 00:38:17.920
Your dad was so mad at me.
If he knows that I follow you here,

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:19.800
he will be mad again.

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.041
Don't tell anyone that I'm here.

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:27.801
We'll talk later.

00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:59.440
After the wedding,

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:04.680
you're gonna transfer all assets to be under Pin's name, right?

00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:09.011
That's right.

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.720
After I'm done finding

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.200
concession to open timber business in Thailand,

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.240
Pin needs to transfer them back to be under my name

00:39:17.657 --> 00:39:18.658
and my son's name.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.560
And I'll provide money to you like we agreed.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.200
Sounds good to you?

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.200
Not a problem.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:33.040
As long as our children are in love,

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:35.120
it won't be my problem.

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:24.241
Sasin?

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.080
You followed us here?

00:40:56.177 --> 00:40:57.481
It's all in my head.

00:41:48.243 --> 00:41:49.244
What is this?

00:41:49.617 --> 00:41:50.920
I sent you a signal

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:53.523
randomly, I don't know which room you stay.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.057
I'm glad you found me.

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.360
Why did you call me here?

00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.840
I'm gonna tell you

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.800
about the plan to stop the wedding of you and Pin.

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.281
Really?

00:42:06.097 --> 00:42:08.000
- What?
- It seemed like the light was coming this way.

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:11.100
Let's hide.

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:17.320
So dark.

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.720
- Can you see anything?
- I didn't see anything.

00:42:23.057 --> 00:42:24.058
Is this the one?

00:42:25.777 --> 00:42:26.840
So dark in here.

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:35.520
I can't see anything.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.720
The light that you saw

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:40.400
- could be a ghost.
- Come on.

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.160
What ghost?

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.160
Prince Kamfah also saw it, he told me to look around.

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:49.560
He's worried that
Kalong and Prince Inthorn would follow us here.

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:57.760
You two need to look on that side.

00:42:58.317 --> 00:42:59.600
I'll look around this side.

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:20.921
What is it?

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:22.900
They're all here?

00:43:23.761 --> 00:43:26.880
Because of you, your light was so bright,
I thought the whole beach saw you.

00:43:30.637 --> 00:43:32.840
We should find a quiet place to talk

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.800
about my plan. Let's go.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.160
Hey!

00:43:41.757 --> 00:43:43.157
Hey!

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.081
- Hop on.
- What're you doing?

00:43:47.481 --> 00:43:50.920
Your dad's people are all over the land,
let's talk in the sea. Come on.

00:43:58.157 --> 00:43:59.158
Watch out!

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:09.880
Wait!

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:11.091
Hey!

00:44:11.177 --> 00:44:13.360
What're you doing?
We don't know whose boat it is.

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:18.280
Don't worry, it belongs to a fisherman around here.

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:21.960
I'm close with them.
I hung out here all the time when I was little.

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:23.640
You can sit there.

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:25.920
Come on, the boat will leave the shore soon.

00:44:40.850 --> 00:44:41.851
You ready?

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:43.841
We're leaving now.

00:45:28.383 --> 00:45:30.300
Why did you stop?

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:32.000
Are we gonna talk here?

00:45:34.763 --> 00:45:36.880
I didn't, I think we're running out of gasoline.

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:48.080
Yep, no gas left.

00:45:48.383 --> 00:45:50.070
What should we do?

00:45:50.817 --> 00:45:51.960
Calm down.

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:56.000
We're gonna wait here
until the other boats come around.

00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:59.960
They'll be hunting for fish when it's getting late.

00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:11.311
Damn it!

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:12.791
What it is?

00:46:13.357 --> 00:46:14.240
What's going on?

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:17.480
Hey! What should we do?

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:18.801
Watch out!

00:46:20.697 --> 00:46:21.698
Saenkaew?

00:46:23.237 --> 00:46:24.238
Saenkaew?

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.640
I called you, you didn't hear me?

00:46:31.597 --> 00:46:33.080
What should we do?

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:38.600
Hold on tight, okay?

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:43.091
Hey!

00:46:44.177 --> 00:46:45.720
We can't just wait here on the boat.

00:46:51.743 --> 00:46:53.960
There's a small island not too far from here.

00:46:54.283 --> 00:46:55.360
You think you can swim there?

00:46:56.977 --> 00:46:57.978
But…

00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:00.080
It's not safe in here.

00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:02.680
If the storm gets stronger,
we will be drifting further away from the shore.

00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:06.371
Don't worry.

00:47:06.857 --> 00:47:08.720
I'm here with you,
I won't let anything happen to you.

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:16.961
Let's go.

00:47:51.517 --> 00:47:52.600
What is it?

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:54.761
Saenkaew is not here.

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.521
The light that you saw earlier?

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:02.322
You think he could be abducted?

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:07.360
Let's split and find him.

00:48:09.117 --> 00:48:10.118
Yes, sir.

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:46.960
How're you?

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:55.240
There's a small cottage that
the fishermen used to hide from storm.

00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.960
It's over there. We should get there.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.040
Let's go. It's getting stronger.

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:30.300
There's some fuel in here, that's good.

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.800
- Are you cold?
- Yeah.

00:49:54.737 --> 00:49:56.120
Some clean clothes are here.

00:50:00.237 --> 00:50:01.238
Why don't you change?

00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:25.471
Hey!

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:27.881
Hey!

00:50:30.783 --> 00:50:31.784
What're you doing?

00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:35.091
What?

00:50:35.923 --> 00:50:37.080
I need to change my clothes.

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:39.761
You want me to wear wet clothes?

00:50:40.161 --> 00:50:41.480
I could get pneumonia.

00:50:46.277 --> 00:50:48.000
You need to change too, hurry up.

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:45.200
Snake!

00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:47.240
Watch out!

00:52:48.077 --> 00:52:50.250
- What is it?
- Snake!

00:52:56.503 --> 00:52:57.440
It's not a snake.

00:53:00.857 --> 00:53:02.920
It's just a rope.

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:06.840
- I thought it was a snake.
- What snake?

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:08.521
You scared me.

00:53:10.121 --> 00:53:11.640
What if it bit you?
