00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.520
I was cold and starving,

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.130
utterly desperate.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.110
Weiran and Ning Fei

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.170
risked their lives
to steal a roasted sweet potato

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.780
and secretly brought it to me.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.240
Yixiao,

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.440
I hid it in my clothes,

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:13.510
so no one found it.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.130
It's still warm. Eat it now.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.440
Yes, hurry and eat.

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.910
-We're not hungry.
-We're not hungry.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:31.390
I'm fine.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.870
You eat it.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.050
Eat it now.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:34.790
Eat.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.880
Is it good?

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.220
If it's good, eat more.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:50.210
Without them,

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.210
I wouldn't be alive today.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.550
So what?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.430
The past is the past.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.760
People's hearts change easily.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:00.790
Everything

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.900
in the world is constantly changing.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.440
People's hearts are even harder to read.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.240
Once

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.390
we were enemies.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.650
And now,
we're sitting at the same table.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:12.390
Can the past

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.930
really stay in the past?

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.330
Don't you want revenge?

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.630
You couldn't do it yourself,

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.290
and you're here to lecture me?

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.650
You'll soon see a good show.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.340
Be sure to watch it when it starts.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.280
If you don't dare to face it,

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:41.760
how can you let it go?

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.680
Stop looking.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:01.970
All of you, get out!

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.440
Be good and leave.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.510
Shunzi.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:12.850
How did you know

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.440
to go to Zhengnian Villa to find Master?

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:17.210
It was Brother Weiran.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.390
He said Master had been
taken away by bad people,

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:22.480
got injured,

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.790
and might be recovering
at Zhengnian Villa.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.440
When?

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.440
Right before you left,

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:30.720
Brother Weiran

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.120
told me that.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.750
Don't move!

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.360
I haven't finished stitching your wound.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:38.840
You…

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.790
-Brother Ning Fei.
-Brother Ning Fei.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:43.840
Brother Ning Fei!

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.720
-Brother Ning Fei.
-You may tear your wound open.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.320
You idiot, do you want to die?

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:56.940
Your Highness,

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:58.080
Ning Fei is here.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:59.800
Why is he here again?

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.300
Your Highness,

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.990
what does he want this time?

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.750
He's here for Xiao Weiran.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.150
So he's finally figured it out.

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:20.360
He's inside.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.170
Say what you need to say.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:37.790
Ning Fei?

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:42.300
Why are you here?

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:43.960
How are things outside?

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:49.920
Say something!

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.200
Does His Highness

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.460
have
a message for me?

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:54.110
I haven't seen His Highness.

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:57.500
Feng Suige sent you?

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.860
I have some questions for you.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:03.840
The day Yixiao fell off the cliff,

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.570
you said someone witnessed it.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.240
Who was it?

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.030
I see.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.270
It was all your plan.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.360
You told me to pull back the patrols…

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.490
Ning Fei, shut up!

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:21.790
I'll kill you!

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.820
Why?

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:24.550
Why?

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:25.700
Why?

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:27.240
Why did you try to kill Yixiao?

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.240
Answer me! Answer me! Answer me!

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.030
Answer me!

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:32.790
Ning Fei!

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:37.830
Let me ask you,

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.170
if His Highness ordered Yixiao's death,

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.760
would you kill her or not?

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.670
On one side was Jinxiu's great cause

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.320
and a military order.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.620
On the other side was someone
you saw as family.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.500
How would you choose?

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:09.010
As a soldier,

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:11.160
I must serve my country.

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:12.630
As a subordinate,

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:15.870
I must serve my master.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:25.730
Ning Fei,

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.760
I didn't want you to know all this

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.630
because I didn't want you to bear

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.030
this heart-eating pain.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:35.030
I failed Yixiao.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.980
I betrayed my principles.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.240
I deserve to go to hell after I die.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.570
That's my retribution!

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:46.350
But you don't know anything.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.220
None of this
had anything to do with you!

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:56.320
Yixiao?

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:41.610
Weiran was right.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.130
As subordinates,

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:46.360
we should serve our master.

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:49.760
If it were me,

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.060
maybe I'd be torn too.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.960
In that case…

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:58.830
let's stop
making things hard

00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:59.720
for each other.

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:05.040
We were family once.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.110
The three of us grew up together,

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.370
fought side by side,

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:12.770
and protected each other.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.440
That bond was real.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:18.090
And that's enough.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.440
I forgot to tell you something.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.070
When we were kids,

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:37.750
you always gave
me
the precious sweet potatoes.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.680
I actually didn't like them at all.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:44.880
I only ate them because

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.880
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.880
Now it's perfect.

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:50.450
I'll never have to eat them again.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.850
From this day on,

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.480
the Three Heroes of Jinxiu are strangers!

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.210
Swords will draw blood,
and all ties are severed!

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.960
Yixiao.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.850
No.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.830
The great cause of Jinxiu

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:13.590
has nothing to do

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:15.100
with me anymore!

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:16.920
No matter why Xia Jingshi

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.000
wants to kill me,

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:18.960
whatever scheme

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.120
he's plotting,

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:21.750
I won't let him succeed!

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.440
I'll make him pay!

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.250
Yixiao, stop!

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.600
Don't talk nonsense.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:51.220
What do you mean by cutting all ties?

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.950
With whom are you cutting ties?

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:53.960
Weiran was wrong.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:54.680
He knows he was wrong.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:55.740
I apologize to you on his behalf.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.400
Yixiao, don't say things you don't mean.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.460
Yixiao, stop!

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.020
His Highness must have forced him.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:01.440
Weiran always obeys him.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.880
This couldn't have been his choice.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.940
Stop talking!

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.040
I understand.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.010
Mistakes have consequences.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:09.830
A simple apology

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:10.680
isn't enough.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:11.940
How about this?

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:12.940
I'll go stab him

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:14.030
to make it up to you.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.120
Do you think I want this?

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.560
I don't want this either.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.130
Forget it, Ning Fei.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.520
It's useless.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:23.930
We can't go back.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.160
None of us can go back.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:29.590
He's not the Xiao Weiran

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:30.450
we used to know.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.340
And I'm no longer the Yixiao I was.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.010
How did we end up like this?

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:43.000
What are we gonna do?

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:44.550
Yixiao,

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.280
we promised each other a future.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Are you asking me?

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:51.300
I don't know either.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.240
Yixiao.

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:08.350
Ning Fei!

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:09.150
Ning Fei!

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.440
What's wrong with you?

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.880
Ning Fei!

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.070
Ning Fei!

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.510
Your Highness,

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:19.400
I recorded

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.570
their conversation

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:21.450
word for word

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:23.080
without missing anything.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:24.560
It basically confirms

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:24.790
[Xiao: Ning Fei, I had my reasons.]

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:25.200
what Miss Yixiao said earlier.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:25.890
[Ning: What reasons? We adopted]

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.440
[those kids with Yixiao.]

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:27.720
After the Battle of Pingling,

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.830
Xia Jingshi and people from Susha

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:29.830
were having a secret meeting in camp.

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:30.680
Maybe Miss Yixiao

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:31.750
overheard something

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.270
and argued with Xia Jingshi.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:34.480
But what it was exactly—

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.480
we don't know yet.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.370
As for Xiao Weiran,

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.240
do we keep him locked up?

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:39.680
Yes.

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:43.050
Hold him until Xia Jingshi comes for him.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.510
Yes.

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:46.750
By the way, Your Highness,

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:47.590
Ning Fei was badly injured

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.050
when
fighting Xun Xiang.

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:50.350
He was shaken in prison just now

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.080
and fainted.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.030
Miss Yixiao has already taken him

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:54.400
to Young Mistress Ling for treatment.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.610
How is he now?

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:56.970
From what I saw,

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:58.270
his wound is festering.

00:21:58.270 --> 00:21:59.600
He seems to be poisoned.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.070
I wonder if Young Mistress Ling is

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:02.070
able to save him.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.820
I need raw Pinellia and Arisaema.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.240
He…

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:31.110
How is he now?

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:33.830
That arrow was poisoned.

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.100
It's been left in for too long.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.480
I'm afraid the poison

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.160
has already reached his heart and lungs.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.270
It's not that I'm not skilled enough.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:41.800
Even if my father were here,

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:43.660
he probably couldn't save him.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:47.440
Then...

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:49.920
how long does he have?

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.900
Two or three days, at most.

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:10.610
Where are you going at this late hour?

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.370
Meeting Xia Jingshi now

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.510
is hardly a wise move.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.400
I heard Ning Fei is gravely wounded
and dying.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.960
I figured you'd storm off in anger

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.360
to confront Xia Jingshi.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.440
I'm not here for anything else today,

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.410
just to stop you.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:31.150
Thanks for your concern.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.100
But I need

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.930
to face some things myself.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:36.640
Have you thought about

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.170
what to say when you see him?

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.400
Are you sure you can get him to reveal

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.030
why he wants you dead?

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:46.070
Or do you think

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.830
he'll actually tell you the truth?

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:49.180
Whether he does or not,

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:51.180
I want to hear his explanation.

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:52.640
If it weren't for him,

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.480
we Three Heroes of Jinxiu

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.030
wouldn't have ended up like this.

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:55.690
I'll settle

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.160
that score with him sooner or later.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.490
You absolutely should.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.000
But if you're thinking
of

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.720
killing him today to vent your anger,

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.850
I have to remind you—

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.270
the royal villa is guarded

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:11.870
by Susha's Imperial Guards.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.000
I know.

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:15.350
Even if you're lucky enough to kill him,

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:16.230
you'll lose your own life

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:17.090
in the process.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.070
Is it really worth it?

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.510
[Heaven Coffin Shop]

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:26.570
I decide whether it's worth it or not.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:27.790
Besides,

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:29.110
we don't just do things

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:30.510
because they are worth it.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:31.390
You're right.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.140
Some things

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:34.110
are worth

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:35.130
going through hell and high water for.

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:36.680
[Heaven Coffin Shop]

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:37.980
But if you were going to act on impulse,

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.640
you would've done it long ago.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:41.670
You've swallowed your pride

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:42.790
and endured until now.

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:44.180
Wasn't it all to uncover the truth?

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:47.060
[Heaven Coffin Shop]

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:06.590
Your Highness,

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:08.270
I personally went to Zhengnian Hall.

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:08.740
Officer Ning is

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.030
indeed badly wounded.

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:11.410
Your Highness,

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:12.530
should we

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:13.530
bring him back?

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:14.930
[Xia Jingshi]

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.670
When did the three of them meet?

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.200
According to the patrol unit,

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.730
it was around noon yesterday.

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:23.880
[Xia Jingshi]

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.240
Military Advisor Xiao was locked up

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:25.800
by Feng Suige

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.880
in the patrol unit's prison.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:27.200
[Seal of Xia Jingshi, Prince of Zhennan]

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.350
It's surrounded by guards.

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:29.480
Our men can't get in.

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.370
Has Yixiao been there?

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:32.160
No.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:35.300
Take this letter

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.240
to Xue Yan.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:38.060
Tell him

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:39.780
to get Xiao Weiran out

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.440
at all costs.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:42.480
If needed,

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.110
he can use the marriage alliance
as leverage.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.640
Yes.

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:54.590
Xia Jingshi only sent someone

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:55.270
to Zhengnian Hall

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.470
to ask about Ning Fei.

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.480
Other than that,

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.140
he hasn't done anything else.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.400
Who would've thought
the Prince of Zhennan

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.660
would be so heartless?

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:03.720
Ning Fei has been

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.110
through thick and thin with him.

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:06.510
Now that Ning Fei is dying,

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:08.110
he just turns his back on him.

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.020
Your Highness,

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.880
doesn't he fear

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.210
disheartening his men?

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:15.680
I had you leak Ning Fei's condition

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.700
to Xia Jingshi

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.640
not to see how cold he is

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:19.910
to his subordinates.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.080
Then what's your intention?

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.600
If a Jinxiu guard officer

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:25.870
dies in Susha
right before the wedding,

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:27.530
regardless of the reason,

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:29.000
it could sabotage

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.330
the marriage alliance.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:31.920
Xia Jingshi

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.200
hasn't made a fuss

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.560
about Ning Fei,

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.720
which means he doesn't want
the alliance ruined either.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.050
So Your Highness thinks

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:41.750
this marriage alliance is
part of his plan?

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:42.310
No.

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:44.160
It wasn't Xia Jingshi

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.280
who proposed it.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.010
It was the Emperor of Jinxiu—Xia Jingyan.

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:49.240
At most, Xia Jingshi is
using

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.900
the marriage for his own ends.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:52.800
Then what exactly does he want?

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.680
Fu Yixiao.

00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:58.160
That's why Xia Jingshi came

00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.220
for this alliance—

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:01.490
to take Fu Yixiao away.

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:24.150
Sister,

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:25.110
stop wiping.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.270
You haven't slept all night.

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:28.420
Go get some rest.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.440
How is he?

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.220
I just finished the acupuncture.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.180
Some of the poisoned blood
has been drained.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.790
Will he wake up?

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:40.370
It's already a miracle
that he made it through the night.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.440
There were several times

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.170
I couldn't even find his pulse.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:44.750
Sister,

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.830
I'm sorry.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.110
It's all my fault.

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:49.240
My medical skills aren't good enough.

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:50.240
It's all my fault.

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:51.340
Don't say that.

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:53.370
You've done your best.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.240
It's my fault.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.620
I shouldn't have doubted him.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.110
I should've seen from the start

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:05.110
that this had nothing to do with him.

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:07.280
I never should've dragged him into this.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.410
And I definitely shouldn't have
said those harsh words.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.780
Those who want me dead are Xiao Weiran

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.340
and Xia Jingshi.

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:16.390
He's never done

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.980
anything wrong.

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:23.530
When he was little, he used to say

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:24.920
he wanted a home.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:27.590
He said we Three Heroes of Jinxiu

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:28.680
should go somewhere

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.140
with mountains and rivers

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:32.930
and have a house to grow old in together.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:34.710
We'll bask in the sun,

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:36.090
grow some flowers,

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:38.910
and stop fighting and killing.

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:41.810
The house doesn't need to be big—

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.040
just a place we can call home.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.160
I don't know what else I can do

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.030
for him now.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.270
With this,

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:57.440
at least he can finally have a home.

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:01.920
[Zhengnian Hall]

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:02.400
Sir.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.060
We're here.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.970
We're here.

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:10.550
[Ling Feng, Master of Zhengnian Villa]

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:12.050
[Zhengnian Hall]

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.350
You fool.

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:17.620
Wake up, Ning Fei.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.110
Ning Fei!

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:20.710
Ling Xueying!

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:22.830
Father!

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:24.140
Let go of him.

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:24.920
Your hands…

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:25.410
Let go.

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.040
Let go of him!

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.740
What are you doing?

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:30.790
I'm treating him.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.880
Who taught you to treat a patient

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.550
while bawling your eyes out like that?

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:36.030
You.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.010
Me?

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.760
Give me a break!

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:41.310
Father, save him.

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:43.230
Please help him.

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:47.240
That coffin by the door

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.370
is prepared for him?

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.480
Well-timed.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.120
We'll be needing it soon.

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:52.030
Father,

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:52.830
please save him.

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:54.200
I'm begging you to save him.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:54.680
Father.

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:55.970
Save him?

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.350
He's already at death's door.

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:58.830
Do you want me to ruin my spotless record?

00:29:58.830 --> 00:29:59.560
Come with me.

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:00.310
Father,

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:01.570
what are you doing?

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:03.590
Got any silver on you?

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.200
Pay the coachman for me.

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:05.830
My medicine box

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:07.400
is still being held as collateral.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.370
Listen to me.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.270
The box is more important than him.

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:10.300
Hurry, let's go.

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:11.840
Father,

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.430
what are you doing?

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:17.950
You paid the coachman for me?

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.860
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.080
Lord Ling.

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.400
I've had people
searching for you all over.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.030
Why has it been

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:25.110
so hard to find you?

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:27.750
A patient asked me
to find some medicine for him.

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:29.010
What do you need me for?

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:30.630
Naturally, I need your help.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.680
I need you to check on a friend's injury.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:34.920
What kind of friend

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.320
deserves such concern
from Your Highness?

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:39.070
She's inside.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:40.650
Come with me.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:44.240
Father.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:44.830
Come.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.880
Clench your fist.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.480
Harder.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:58.730
Alright.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.200
Let me take a look.

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:03.270
Aside from the injury to your hand,

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:04.530
you also have amnesia.

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:05.980
Falling from that height

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:07.440
and not ending up in pieces,

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.790
you must've been caught

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:10.030
by branches
on the way down.

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:11.350
They slowed your fall.

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:12.680
As for the amnesia,

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.340
since it's from a head trauma,

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:16.880
it means there's a clot in your brain.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:17.730
The clot

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.090
is the real problem.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.830
Torn tendons can be reattached.

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:22.270
As for the clot,

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:23.270
with time and treatment,

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:24.130
it can be fixed.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:25.400
Yixiao,

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.240
I told you

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:28.000
my father would definitely heal you.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:28.600
Thank you.

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:30.630
I have a difficult request.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.340
My injury is not

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:34.230
worth troubling you, Lord Ling.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.270
I only hope
you can

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:36.390
save my brother.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.310
Brother?

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:44.300
That dying man on the bed?

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:46.130
Yes.

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:47.270
Haven't you already prepared

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:48.200
a coffin for him?

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.340
Better to bury him soon.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:51.480
Father,

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:52.750
are you seriously going

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:53.400
to just let him die?

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.350
I seriously am.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.070
His pulse is shallow, fading fast,

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:57.750
barely there—
just the signs of heart failure.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:58.350
It won't be long

00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:59.640
before he takes his last breath.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.480
I, Ling Feng, only treat

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.740
those who can be saved.

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.490
I never fight Hades for a soul.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.520
Lord Ling.

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:06.720
Please, save him!

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:08.180
Yixiao, don't do this.

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:09.220
Father,

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:10.380
Yixiao is my sister.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.030
Her brother

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:11.950
is my brother.

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:14.350
Lord Ling, your skills are unmatched.

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:15.640
There must be another way.

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.590
If you can save him,

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:17.440
I'll do anything you ask.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.030
Miss,

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:19.770
rules are rules.

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:20.880
No amount of pleading will change that.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.660
Get up.

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:22.400
I won't.

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:23.270
Lord Ling,

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:24.030
your skills

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.880
can work miracles,

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:25.720
and you have a kind heart.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:26.510
Please, I beg you.

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:27.480
You can't just leave him to die.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:27.830
Yixiao.

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:28.400
I can!

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:29.520
Lord Ling!

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:32.400
Yixiao.

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.680
Father!

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.570
Wait for me, Father.

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:46.240
She's my sister.

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.270
You must help her.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.400
Zhengnian Hall.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.640
I-I'm in Yujing now.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.400
I need a place to stay, don't I?

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.840
Besides,

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:56.830
Zhengnian Villa

00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:57.720
having a branch in Yujing

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.220
isn't a bad thing, right?

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:00.290
Such a big house

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.310
must be expensive.

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:02.840
Where did you get the money?

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.100
I put it on the Emperor of Susha's tab.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.070
You foolish girl!

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:10.730
You've got some nerve!

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.510
You're driving me crazy.

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:14.880
Father, where are you going?

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:15.810
Where am I going?

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.570
You're such a troublemaker!

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:18.540
I have to run.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.000
With all that debt you racked up,

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.590
how am I supposed to pay it back?

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:22.120
Also,

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.510
that guy is practically
in his grave already,

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:25.010
and you want me to save him?

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.920
Why don't you just bury me

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.270
with him and be done with it?

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:27.890
Father!

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:31.320
What do you mean?

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:32.840
Lord Ling,

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.300
forgive me.

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:42.360
Your Highness, what's the meaning of this?

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.110
That girl even knelt to you.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.060
Helping her

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:48.210
would hardly cost you a thing.

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:49.600
She knelt to me. So what?

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.780
I could kneel to her too if needed.

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:52.480
Besides,

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:54.710
am I supposed to help everyone who asks?

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:56.750
Those stupid rules of your Zhengnian Villa

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:58.160
should be changed.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.130
Take Lord Ling to the medical hall.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:02.560
Lord Ling,

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:03.840
please.

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.580
Trying to strong-arm me, huh?

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.210
Wanna fight?

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:10.389
Don't make me prick you with needles!

00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:11.230
-Father!
-Let go of me!

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:12.590
I'm warning you,
I'll prick you with needles!

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:13.469
Let go!

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:24.940
This is my father's

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:26.280
Seven-Aperture Acupuncture.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.139
It can bring the dead back to life.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.659
It looks simple,

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.230
but every twist

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:31.760
and insertion

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.159
requires precise skill.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.440
Since my father

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.790
agreed to save Ning Fei,

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.760
he's definitely not going to die.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.520
Didn't Lord Ling just say

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:41.120
this man couldn't be saved?

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:42.480
Did I say he'd survive?

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.710
I've only temporarily sealed

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:44.710
his heart meridian

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:46.639
to control the poison in his blood.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:47.320
To put it plainly,

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.179
I'm just buying him two more days.

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:49.840
That's impossible.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.000
Nothing is impossible.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.290
I don't do miracles.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.550
When I say he can't be saved,

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:54.580
he can't be saved.

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:55.969
Would I lie about that?

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.280
If he can't be saved,

00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.440
why make him live two more days?

00:34:59.440 --> 00:34:59.980
Just because I can't

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:01.580
save him doesn't mean no one…

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.210
can save him.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:05.890
Who can save him?

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:08.840
There is a place where they have

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.040
a secret blood replacement technique.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.620
It might save his life.

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:14.660
Where is that place?

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.550
It's located outside
the borders

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:17.960
of Susha and Jinxiu.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.930
Ordinary people can't even

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:21.670
hear of this secret place,

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.660
let alone get in.

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.500
They have a rule—

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.400
anyone who enters

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.060
must become one of them

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.520
and swear a blood oath

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.570
to never betray them or escape.

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.550
Father,

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:37.990
how do you know about this place?

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.510
I once saved one of those people

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:43.550
in the woods.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.490
That's how I knew their secret.

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:49.440
Miss,

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.610
are you sure about this?

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.440
If you send your brother there,

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.610
even if he's saved,

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.700
he'll likely never be free again.

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:08.280
I'm sure.

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:10.840
Being alive is more important
than anything.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:11.400
I agree.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.110
I agree to any condition.

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:13.640
Alright.

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:15.150
Does he have any blood relatives?

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:15.880
The contract

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.630
requires a handprint
from a close relative.

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:18.490
He's an orphan.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.220
I'm the only family he has.

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:22.140
That's a problem.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.410
What's the problem?

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.480
It's just a handprint.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.080
I'll do it.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.280
If you put your handprint,

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.030
you'll be

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:28.150
the guarantor.

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:29.760
Their rules are strict.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:30.590
What they say goes.

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:31.670
If your brother escapes,

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:33.030
you'll need to bring him back.

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.210
If you can't,

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.110
you'll have to repay

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:36.630
the debt of gratitude in his place.

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:37.430
I understand.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.230
Who's going to draft the contract?

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:40.490
You don't understand.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:42.760
They are going to save his life.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:43.760
If he runs,

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.320
you'll have to give your life
in his place.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:45.930
I know.

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:47.360
I'm willing to bear all consequences.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.030
Father,

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:48.800
what kind of place is that?

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.480
Why does it have

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.840
even more rules than our Zhengnian Villa?

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:51.960
What do you know?

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.110
If people there are willing to help,

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:55.630
except for those already claimed by death,

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:57.090
they can save anyone.

00:36:57.590 --> 00:36:58.260
Father,

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:00.190
that doesn't sound like you.

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:01.000
In all my life,

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:02.920
I've never seen you admit
someone else is better.

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.580
Then you haven't seen enough.

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:06.390
Draft the contract now.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:09.070
I'm afraid
Ning Fei won't last much longer.

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:24.470
What are you doing?

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:25.990
Making Xia Jingshi and the others

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:27.670
believe that Ning Fei is already dead.

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:29.000
It makes things easier.

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.220
Once he leaves this place,

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.710
he'll no longer be involved
in worldly conflicts.

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:35.240
Jinxiu and Susha

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.590
will have nothing to do with him anymore.

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:38.480
This is probably

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.810
the best ending for him.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.180
Thank you.

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:43.670
Miss,

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:46.990
I've taken the contract.

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:48.110
From this day on,

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:49.640
you'll be held accountable

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.920
for everything

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:51.890
this man does.

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.920
Don't worry.

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:55.240
We're not related by blood,

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.880
but we'll be family for life.

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:58.880
As long as he's alive, that's enough.

00:37:58.880 --> 00:37:59.410
Alright.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:01.710
I'll draw you a map in a bit

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:03.000
and show you the location.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:03.630
Once your people

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:04.630
send him there,

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:05.630
they'll take him

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:07.090
after they see the letter.

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:07.750
Remember—

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.030
when your people arrive,

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:10.430
they must be blindfolded

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:12.310
and ask no questions at any time.

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:13.680
Understood.

[Jingming Garden]

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:23.270
Thank you for coming in person,

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:24.570
Minister Shen.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.060
Minister Shen.

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:31.670
I've brought the man.

[Jingming Garden]

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.500
On behalf of His Highness,

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:41.800
I thank you.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:08.860
Your Highness.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:10.860
Aren't you curious

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:13.440
why Feng Suige let you return?

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:16.990
Susha had promised

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:18.370
to return Yixiao to me.

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:20.830
But I gave that spot to you.

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:24.630
You shouldn't have saved me.

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:26.200
I shouldn't have saved you?

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:28.390
If I hadn't saved you,

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:30.250
should I have just let you die?

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.150
Better I kill you myself

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:37.140
than let Feng Suige do it!

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.340
What did you do wrong?

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.890
I failed to kill Yixiao.

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:10.250
Do you have a death wish?

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.140
Your Highness,

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:12.690
Yixiao cannot be spared.

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:15.630
She's forgotten everything.

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:16.280
She was about

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.320
to come back to me.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.220
Why did you act on your own?

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.030
Why did you ruin everything?

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.010
She already knows

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.650
you were the one
who shot her off the cliff.

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:27.040
She also knows

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:29.110
I sent assassins after her.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.360
You know better than anyone

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.620
how capable Yixiao is.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:33.140
If she lives,

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:35.280
she'll be a threat to you.

You're in no position

to make decisions for me.

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:47.970
Your Highness.

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:49.630
I just couldn't bear

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:51.190
to see you backed into a corner again.

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:52.030
Everything I've done

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:53.230
was all for you!

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.460
You resent me.

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.260
I don't dare.

You resent me for going back on my word.

You resent me
for failing to protect Yixiao.

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:04.580
Yixiao is your family.

No!
