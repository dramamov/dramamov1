[Episode 21]

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.550
Mother was right.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.070
She wasn't the one
who poisoned or hexed me.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.710
It was you.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.870
The Yan Hui you saw before

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:43.590
was actually Sang Li in disguise...

You're still making excuses.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.430
At our wedding,

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.220
we made vows before our ancestors.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.730
We drank the wedding wine

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.510
and wished to be together

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.690
for all eternity.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.510

Che.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.610
You're finally here.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.760
Hurry.

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:47.690
The water from the moat

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.920
will soon flow into every household.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.159
Once they drink this water,

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.310
within 15 minutes,

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.610
their intestines will rot

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.040
and they'll die in agony.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.640
Issue the order.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.550
Make everyone in the palace

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.500
drink the water from the bowl.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.730
They are all worthless people.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:06.850
Kill them all

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.320
and you will gain the empire.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.630
Che.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:12.610
Give the order.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.190
Make them drink
all the water in the bowl.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.000
Mother,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.950
you just said

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.210
only by killing them all could I do what?

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.850
Only then can you gain the entire empire!

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.020
This is spring water
I bestow upon you all.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:31.700
Drink it.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.820
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.070
So sweet.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.840
Mother, you're so happy.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.040
You seem more like
the person who wll rule this land,

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.360
rather than me.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.380
Mother, you want
to kill everyone in Daning,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.490
including all the soldiers

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.560
and all the officials in the palace,

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.750
leaving only me,

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.370
a Drug Man controlled by you.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.890
Then this world
will certainly be yours.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.850
What does it have to do with me?

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:09.600
You...

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.480
Mother, you're wondering

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.500
why your medicine suddenly stopped working

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.080
and want to give me more?

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.830
How are you so lucid?

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.220
How is this possible?

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.250
With a mother like you,

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.480
no wonder Jun Che
became a tyrant in his previous life.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.070
I've been wondering

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.840
what kind of mother

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.659
would cause him such suffering.

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:35.540
Today I finally see clearly.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.360
They say even tigers don't eat their cubs,

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.070
but you not only devoured yours,

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.000
you didn't even spit out the bones.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.510
Who are you really?

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.930
Weren't you the one
who put drugs in my bath,

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.920
making Jun Che confused

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.510
and hallucinate?

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.500
Weren't you the one
who made Sang Li control Yan Hui,

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.860
having him lie in my bed

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.600
to drive a wedge between Jun Che and me?

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.350
Lu Yingying.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.360
Where is Jun Che?

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.450
You think you're
the only one who can control him?

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.480
It was all my foolishness.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.870
I listened to the Saintess

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.310
and controlled Yan Hui's body

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.600
to pressure His Majesty.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.760
She threatened you
with my brother's life.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.490
That's why
you were forced to control my brother.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.390
Control?

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.430
Do you still have
the Heart-Binding Poison?

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.310
The Heart-Binding Poison can only
be used on one person in a lifetime.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.000
I've already used mine on Yan Hui.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.830
I mean

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.830
a brand new Heart-Binding Poison worm.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.250
You want to control His Majesty

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.720
the same way I controlled Yan Hui?

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.360
Yes.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.080
His Majesty is unconscious.

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:49.620
Watch over him carefully.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.770
You're the Empress?

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:58.560
Guards!

00:07:58.870 --> 00:07:59.190
Seize her...

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.250
-Freeze!
-Freeze!

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.480
All your men have been captured.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.480
Sang Li.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.160
Don't forget

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.920
your lover's life

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.480
is still in my hands.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.360
I see now.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.490
So you've been in cahoots all along.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.710
I was once deceived
by the former emperor of Daning.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.590
And now I'm being deceived by you again.

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:34.169
People of Daning are truly cunning.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:36.250
You all truly deserve to die.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.080
The guilty party accuses first.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.090
You're the one who wants
to kill the people of Daning.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:41.530
How is that the Daning people's fault?

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:42.620
What do you know?

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.640
I was once the Saintess of Yue State.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.490
I should have been respected.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.150
But what did
that bastard emperor of Daning

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:50.220
do to me?

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:52.120
He abducted me by force

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.380
and forced me to bear that bastard child.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.150
How could his blood alone

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.390
be enough to repay
all the humiliation I've suffered?

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:01.060
But the common people
of Daning are innocent.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:01.970
Innocent?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.150
They enjoy the benefits of Daning.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.080
They kneel before
that bastard emperor every day.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.380
How are they innocent?

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.840
That's absurd.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:10.900
What about Jun Che?

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:12.510
Your own flesh and blood.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.720
What flesh and blood?

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.090
When has he ever treated me as his mother?

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.120
From the moment he saw me,

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.320
he couldn't wait to throw me in prison.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.440
When he was a child,
you treated him as a Drug Man,

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.030
used him, and then abandoned him.

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:26.360
Now he wants to put you in prison.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.510
How is that wrong?

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.090
I can actually understand you.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.670
You finally managed
to come out of seclusion.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.390
But your enemy is dead.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.120
The resentment in your heart
is hard to dissolve.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.440
At the same time, you know

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.790
your days are numbered.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.960
You're unwilling
to accept it, afraid of death,

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:45.810
terrified of everything.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.140
So you want to drag more people down

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.370
to die with you.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.050
But you've miscalculated.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.630
Today, what awaits you

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.510
is nothing but a dead end.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:06.950
Give me the antidote.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.690
What antidote?

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:09.910
The poison you gave Jun Che

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.320
can only be cured by you.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.340
What are you still
trying to leverage at this point?

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.340
You brought him into this world and

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.630
and never gave him even a hint of warmth—

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.840
only bullying and torment.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.630
When he was a child,
you treated him as a Drug Man.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.400
Then you abandoned him
at the Daning Palace,

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.360
where he was tormented
day and night by the Eldest Prince.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.870
Now he has finally grown up

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.600
and become the emperor of the realm.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.460
Yet you still want
to turn him into a walking corpse.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.440
His father may have wronged you,

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.040
but Jun Che owes you nothing.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.710
When you reappeared in his life,

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.440
if he had wanted to kill you,

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.240
he would have had
countless opportunities to do so.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.000
But the reason

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.130
you can still manipulate him like this

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.440
is because he still harbors

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.600
a tiny bit of hope for you as his mother.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.390
Hope.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.240
Yes.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:13.450
It was that bastard emperor's fault.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:17.790
What does it have to do with Che?

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:24.980
The antidote.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.160
Yingying.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:37.900
I'm sorry.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:39.700
You've been poisoned

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.960
and trapped in an illusion.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.160
It was not your fault.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.490
Yingying.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:52.380
Yingying.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:53.600
Yingying!

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:55.480
Yingying!
