00:00:00.945 --> 00:00:02.415
(Episode 18)

00:00:14.455 --> 00:00:16.025
Me and Ji Eun Oh?

00:00:17.155 --> 00:00:18.155
I like Eun Oh?

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:26.335
You scared me.

00:00:27.435 --> 00:00:28.675
Ji Hyuk, what are you doing over there?

00:00:30.235 --> 00:00:31.235
My gosh!

00:00:40.685 --> 00:00:42.855
Su Jeong, you just ruined the surprise.

00:00:44.415 --> 00:00:46.985
I was just about to surprise her.

00:00:52.825 --> 00:00:54.395
(Cafe Agit)

00:01:00.565 --> 00:01:01.635
(Oh Su Jeong)

00:01:05.475 --> 00:01:06.875
Is this for real?

00:01:07.475 --> 00:01:08.475
I mean, on me?

00:01:09.575 --> 00:01:11.645
He was really going to pull a prank?

00:01:12.915 --> 00:01:15.585
We're seeing a whole new side of Ji Hyuk.

00:01:35.575 --> 00:01:37.105
And what's with that dress?

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:39.245
That's totally a date outfit.

00:01:39.675 --> 00:01:42.215
Are you kidding me? It's a long walk from the bus stop to her house.

00:01:43.045 --> 00:01:44.345
She's so unbelievably reckless.

00:01:53.485 --> 00:01:54.485
Ji Eun Oh!

00:01:55.355 --> 00:01:56.355
Eun Oh!

00:02:18.715 --> 00:02:21.645
Chief Cha, you've worked on hanok renovations before, right?

00:02:22.215 --> 00:02:24.555
I've just been assigned a hanok house project.

00:02:24.985 --> 00:02:26.385
What's your availability?

00:02:28.895 --> 00:02:32.165
Okay. I'll let you know when it's set.

00:02:32.865 --> 00:02:33.865
Okay.

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:51.545
I like you.

00:02:52.285 --> 00:02:53.645
I really like you.

00:02:53.985 --> 00:02:56.015
I don't have to give someone a chance...

00:02:56.785 --> 00:02:58.315
if I don't think they suit me.

00:02:58.585 --> 00:03:00.425
Why don't I suit you?

00:03:00.825 --> 00:03:02.085
I just need to understand.

00:03:02.395 --> 00:03:04.695
You and I can never be in a romantic relationship.

00:03:05.095 --> 00:03:06.925
The important thing is that I have no intention.

00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:09.295
Jung Bo A from Haneul Construction.

00:03:09.665 --> 00:03:12.805
This was why Ji Hyuk and I didn't suit each other.

00:03:13.165 --> 00:03:15.035
This is where it ends between us.

00:03:15.435 --> 00:03:17.075
We're no longer friends or anything else.

00:03:17.535 --> 00:03:18.535
Got it?

00:03:24.315 --> 00:03:26.545
Ji Hyuk moved his office?

00:03:34.355 --> 00:03:36.195
I can't believe him.

00:03:41.425 --> 00:03:44.235
If Eun Oh works late, you give her a ride home.

00:03:44.795 --> 00:03:46.105
I moved my office.

00:03:53.575 --> 00:03:54.775
Don't come home too late tonight.

00:03:55.205 --> 00:03:58.115
The restaurant is closed today, so I'll be waiting for you at home.

00:03:58.475 --> 00:03:59.515
What's this?

00:04:01.945 --> 00:04:04.755
Eun Oh, how late are you working tonight?

00:04:05.185 --> 00:04:07.025
Ji Hyuk asked me to give you a ride.

00:04:08.085 --> 00:04:09.355
He asked you to?

00:04:10.755 --> 00:04:12.425
I'm driving you from now on.

00:04:13.225 --> 00:04:16.195
I can't let someone I hurt rely on somebody else.

00:04:16.695 --> 00:04:17.795
Especially my own partner.

00:04:18.265 --> 00:04:19.465
I don't care what anyone says.

00:04:20.865 --> 00:04:22.235
This is ridiculous.

00:04:22.935 --> 00:04:24.675
He said he'd do it with confidence.

00:04:25.135 --> 00:04:26.475
After everything he said and did...

00:04:28.105 --> 00:04:30.075
I guess Ji Hyuk was just messing with you.

00:04:32.715 --> 00:04:35.045
Anyway, I'm heading home early today.

00:04:35.785 --> 00:04:39.485
And I won't need a ride in the morning, Mr. Park.

00:04:40.555 --> 00:04:42.155
I'm not an invalid.

00:04:42.895 --> 00:04:45.195
I'm not taking a morning ride, no matter who's offering.

00:04:58.735 --> 00:05:00.545
So, Lee Ji Hyuk was just messing with me?

00:05:01.005 --> 00:05:02.475
Is that why he smiled like that?

00:05:03.515 --> 00:05:05.215
He's acting so weird.

00:05:12.085 --> 00:05:13.385
I'm home.

00:05:16.925 --> 00:05:19.595
Mom, is something wrong?

00:05:20.225 --> 00:05:21.625
Is that bone broth I smell?

00:05:22.535 --> 00:05:23.535
Is Gang Oh here?

00:05:24.195 --> 00:05:27.065
I'm making this for you to eat, starting tomorrow morning.

00:05:28.335 --> 00:05:29.335
For me?

00:05:30.175 --> 00:05:33.375
- Why all of a sudden? - Come in here for a second.

00:05:53.165 --> 00:05:54.795
Look at you, walking on eggshells around me.

00:05:56.565 --> 00:05:57.565
Eun Oh.

00:05:58.535 --> 00:06:00.065
Why are you walking on eggshells around me?

00:06:01.865 --> 00:06:04.605
What are you talking about? I'm not.

00:06:04.805 --> 00:06:07.875
I'm stuck in the middle here.

00:06:08.905 --> 00:06:12.115
You're my daughter, and Gang Oh is my son.

00:06:12.745 --> 00:06:16.585
I worry about my foolish son, and I worry you'll be hurt. But...

00:06:17.015 --> 00:06:19.755
when you act like that, what am I supposed to think?

00:06:19.955 --> 00:06:23.225
"Well, since Gang Oh is your real son,"

00:06:23.295 --> 00:06:25.195
"this must be harder on you."

00:06:25.865 --> 00:06:27.765
You're thinking that, aren't you?

00:06:27.765 --> 00:06:29.735
That's why you're so careful with me.

00:06:33.665 --> 00:06:34.665
It's just that what Gang Oh said...

00:06:35.905 --> 00:06:38.405
I'm starting to think he was right.

00:06:41.205 --> 00:06:42.975
I tried to tell myself he was wrong.

00:06:44.075 --> 00:06:46.815
But it's true that I took what should have been his.

00:06:48.145 --> 00:06:50.315
I can't get what he said out of my head.

00:06:53.185 --> 00:06:55.655
And part of me wants to give him what he wants.

00:06:56.295 --> 00:06:57.725
Who says it's true?

00:06:58.355 --> 00:07:02.095
What? Is there a set budget for raising a child?

00:07:02.225 --> 00:07:03.995
Like, if you have one,

00:07:03.995 --> 00:07:05.165
you spend a hundred?

00:07:05.165 --> 00:07:06.265
Fifty for two?

00:07:06.365 --> 00:07:07.965
Thirty-three for three? Is that it?

00:07:08.605 --> 00:07:12.035
That's not how it works. Raising a child means...

00:07:12.505 --> 00:07:14.875
you just do the best you can in whatever situation you're in.

00:07:15.305 --> 00:07:19.245
You understand? I never split things between you two.

00:07:20.385 --> 00:07:22.085
Even if it were just Gang Oh,

00:07:22.085 --> 00:07:24.085
do you think Dad would've spoiled him?

00:07:24.155 --> 00:07:27.085
That wasn't your dad's way. Don't you remember what he was like?

00:07:34.665 --> 00:07:38.195
Okay, if Gang Oh had been a girl, he might've gotten a few more shoes,

00:07:38.265 --> 00:07:41.935
or a few more outfits. But that's it.

00:07:42.235 --> 00:07:45.375
There was never a designated "share" for Gang Oh to begin with.

00:07:46.345 --> 00:07:47.375
But still...

00:07:48.045 --> 00:07:49.815
This is so hard on you, Mom.

00:07:51.475 --> 00:07:52.485
It is hard.

00:07:53.085 --> 00:07:54.315
Of course, it's hard.

00:07:55.045 --> 00:07:59.625
I'm your mother and his mother. It's bound to be hard.

00:08:00.555 --> 00:08:03.355
Even if Gang Oh had stayed and you were the one who left,

00:08:03.425 --> 00:08:07.225
it would've been as heartbreaking for me, Eun Oh.

00:08:12.265 --> 00:08:13.405
This whole thing...

00:08:15.365 --> 00:08:19.305
From the moment Gang Oh found out, it's something the three of us...

00:08:19.375 --> 00:08:21.875
were always destined to go through.

00:08:24.815 --> 00:08:26.315
Mom, I'm so sorry.

00:08:27.185 --> 00:08:28.715
I'm sorry.

00:08:33.055 --> 00:08:34.055
You.

00:08:35.085 --> 00:08:36.095
Listen to me.

00:08:37.255 --> 00:08:39.765
Don't even think of getting Gang Oh. Got it?

00:08:41.225 --> 00:08:42.265
To tell you the truth, I...

00:08:42.995 --> 00:08:44.695
I already went to see Gang Oh.

00:08:45.265 --> 00:08:49.205
He's my son. I had to see how he was living.

00:08:49.275 --> 00:08:54.045
I couldn't just stay away. It was a relief to see him.

00:08:54.505 --> 00:08:56.115
Well, at least he's not starving.

00:08:59.315 --> 00:09:00.315
Mom.

00:09:00.985 --> 00:09:02.415
Bring Gang Oh home.

00:09:02.885 --> 00:09:04.655
I'll be fine. I promise.

00:09:07.385 --> 00:09:08.685
I can't bring him home...

00:09:08.685 --> 00:09:11.325
until he fixes his warped thinking on his own.

00:09:11.825 --> 00:09:12.825
Absolutely not.

00:09:13.625 --> 00:09:15.725
He's 24 and done with his military service.

00:09:16.735 --> 00:09:18.295
He's old enough to be on his own.

00:09:20.465 --> 00:09:22.365
But you know how he's living.

00:09:22.875 --> 00:09:24.375
How can you stand it, Mom?

00:09:27.375 --> 00:09:29.945
Why aren't you getting it?

00:09:30.615 --> 00:09:34.445
If you leave, how will I manage with just Gang Oh?

00:09:35.385 --> 00:09:38.715
If we can't get past this, Gang Oh is the only one who loses.

00:09:38.785 --> 00:09:40.355
Because he'll be losing his sister.

00:09:43.395 --> 00:09:44.925
Mom, thank you.

00:09:45.625 --> 00:09:46.795
And I'm sorry.

00:09:50.365 --> 00:09:51.695
Promise me!

00:09:52.295 --> 00:09:55.265
You will not go there and try to placate Gang Oh,

00:09:55.335 --> 00:09:56.705
or even think about bringing him back.

00:09:58.475 --> 00:10:02.545
Gosh, why don't you understand what I'm trying to say?

00:10:02.945 --> 00:10:03.945
Hey.

00:10:05.615 --> 00:10:07.315
Especially when you're so smart.

00:10:08.785 --> 00:10:11.685
You are my daughter.

00:10:12.415 --> 00:10:13.425
And Gang Oh...

00:10:14.625 --> 00:10:15.885
is my son.

00:10:16.995 --> 00:10:17.995
Get it?

00:10:19.995 --> 00:10:20.995
I get it.

00:10:21.365 --> 00:10:22.665
I get it.

00:10:23.235 --> 00:10:24.795
I really get it now, Mom.

00:10:26.265 --> 00:10:27.265
I'm sorry.

00:10:35.105 --> 00:10:36.345
You're really quitting?

00:10:36.575 --> 00:10:39.285
Darn right, I am. This is pathetic. I'm done with this.

00:10:40.245 --> 00:10:42.185
You saw my text, right? Wire me the money now.

00:10:45.255 --> 00:10:47.385
Hey, I just sent it.

00:10:48.025 --> 00:10:49.155
It's minimum wage.

00:10:49.795 --> 00:10:50.795
What?

00:10:51.425 --> 00:10:52.595
I fed you and gave you a roof...

00:10:52.595 --> 00:10:53.965
when you didn't bring the 20,000 dollars.

00:10:54.025 --> 00:10:55.665
You freeloader.

00:11:03.405 --> 00:11:05.735
(Cafe Agit)

00:11:09.975 --> 00:11:10.975
Eun Oh.

00:11:12.815 --> 00:11:14.215
You're here.

00:11:14.915 --> 00:11:17.485
I'm heading to Ji Hyuk's office now. Let's go together.

00:11:19.625 --> 00:11:21.925
But I haven't gotten anything ready yet.

00:11:22.225 --> 00:11:23.425
You guys are partners, aren't you?

00:11:23.855 --> 00:11:25.755
Why get a gift? You're partners.

00:11:27.865 --> 00:11:29.965
Here, let me carry that.

00:11:30.335 --> 00:11:31.595
What happened to your hand?

00:11:31.995 --> 00:11:34.965
I just sprained it a little. It's fine. Here, let me.

00:11:37.075 --> 00:11:38.505
Hyeon Su, you made it.

00:11:39.905 --> 00:11:40.945
Oh, my.

00:11:45.175 --> 00:11:47.245
Ms. Ji, you're here too.

00:11:47.585 --> 00:11:49.755
Hey, what's with you two?

00:11:50.655 --> 00:11:52.585
Ji Hyuk, why are you being so formal with Eun Oh?

00:11:53.385 --> 00:11:57.925
- About that... - It's to keep things professional.

00:11:58.125 --> 00:12:02.695
I want to keep things professional, so I suggested we speak formally.

00:12:03.335 --> 00:12:06.805
This is Team Leader Jo Gyeong Su, who's heading our operations,

00:12:06.905 --> 00:12:09.735
and Cha Cheol Min, who's in charge of the website.

00:12:10.305 --> 00:12:12.635
And this is Architect Jung Hyeon Su,

00:12:12.635 --> 00:12:14.875
a respected senior from Value of Hangyeol.

00:12:15.245 --> 00:12:17.145
Hello. I'm Jo Gyeong Su.

00:12:17.615 --> 00:12:18.915
I've heard a lot about you.

00:12:19.715 --> 00:12:20.915
I'm Cha Cheol Min.

00:12:21.785 --> 00:12:23.355
Hi. I'm Jung Hyeon Su.

00:12:25.415 --> 00:12:26.425
Hey, what is this?

00:12:26.825 --> 00:12:28.325
Did you put on a suit just for me?

00:12:30.095 --> 00:12:32.395
Today's our app launch day,

00:12:32.695 --> 00:12:34.695
so I just came from a meeting with the development team.

00:12:34.695 --> 00:12:35.765
I see.

00:12:37.095 --> 00:12:39.365
This is from Hyeon Su. A coffee machine.

00:12:39.635 --> 00:12:40.835
- Oh, right! - My gosh.

00:12:43.035 --> 00:12:44.435
We'll put it to good use. Thank you.

00:12:45.105 --> 00:12:47.705
You know, the office is...

00:12:48.105 --> 00:12:49.105
smaller than I expected.

00:12:49.815 --> 00:12:53.515
We can't spend much on overhead yet. We have to be frugal.

00:12:53.745 --> 00:12:56.715
Then you should've waited and gotten a bigger office later.

00:12:56.815 --> 00:12:58.085
Why the rush to move out?

00:12:58.455 --> 00:12:59.755
That's exactly what I said.

00:13:01.355 --> 00:13:02.895
I told you, we moved because of you.

00:13:03.195 --> 00:13:04.255
The storage room was too small.

00:13:04.925 --> 00:13:09.295
Either way, the three of us are rarely in the office together.

00:13:09.865 --> 00:13:10.935
He's got a point.

00:13:11.265 --> 00:13:13.665
Something's fishy, Lee Ji Hyuk.

00:13:17.205 --> 00:13:19.645
But why are you two so awkward around each other? You're partners.

00:13:20.045 --> 00:13:21.545
Oh, no, it's not like that.

00:13:22.275 --> 00:13:25.945
- Right! About that turnkey project. - That project...

00:13:26.615 --> 00:13:30.115
You can just talk to Mr. Jo about that.

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:32.215
- Me? - Yes.

00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:35.885
Okay, sure.

00:13:42.595 --> 00:13:43.665
(Park Seong Jae)

00:13:43.695 --> 00:13:44.835
Hyeon Su, excuse me for a second.

00:13:46.165 --> 00:13:48.635
- Hello? - Where are you? I need to see you.

00:13:50.335 --> 00:13:53.675
I'm in a meeting with some guests at the office right now.

00:13:54.605 --> 00:13:57.115
Come out when they leave. I'll text you the location.

00:14:00.745 --> 00:14:01.745
What's his deal?

00:14:07.985 --> 00:14:09.495
That intercept yesterday morning...

00:14:10.055 --> 00:14:11.395
was just a childish prank of mine.

00:14:14.525 --> 00:14:15.525
What?

00:14:15.795 --> 00:14:17.365
Isn't that why you called me out here,

00:14:17.365 --> 00:14:18.435
all furious about it?

00:14:20.165 --> 00:14:21.735
That's not the only reason.

00:14:23.205 --> 00:14:24.705
But since you brought it up, let's start there.

00:14:27.405 --> 00:14:28.505
Do you have feelings for Ji Eun Oh?

00:14:31.775 --> 00:14:32.775
What?

00:14:33.485 --> 00:14:34.645
What nonsense are you talking about now?

00:14:34.715 --> 00:14:36.815
Otherwise, what you did makes no sense.

00:14:37.855 --> 00:14:39.415
You're the one who messed with me first.

00:14:40.955 --> 00:14:43.125
My partner hurt her wrist because of me,

00:14:43.525 --> 00:14:44.955
and when I said I'd take responsibility for it,

00:14:45.955 --> 00:14:46.965
what did you say?

00:14:47.765 --> 00:14:49.395
Something about how I needed to get her permission.

00:14:49.865 --> 00:14:51.795
You completely backed me into a corner.

00:14:52.735 --> 00:14:54.805
So I messed with you a little. So what?

00:14:55.865 --> 00:14:57.805
That's not a prank the Lee Ji Hyuk I know would pull.

00:14:59.575 --> 00:15:01.605
What do you know about me? I'm telling you that's what it was.

00:15:02.445 --> 00:15:03.545
Did you really drag me out here for this?

00:15:04.175 --> 00:15:05.175
Look.

00:15:05.475 --> 00:15:06.615
I'm busy, all right?

00:15:07.785 --> 00:15:08.945
Come on. Let's go.

00:15:12.515 --> 00:15:13.655
No, we're not done talking.

00:15:16.995 --> 00:15:20.295
- You're scaring me, Seong Jae. - You're being weird.

00:15:21.725 --> 00:15:22.795
You've been acting weird.

00:15:23.295 --> 00:15:24.595
You've been acting weird for a while.

00:15:24.595 --> 00:15:25.835
Very weird, in fact.

00:15:27.505 --> 00:15:29.135
When you vanished to the countryside,

00:15:29.135 --> 00:15:30.335
you didn't contact me once.

00:15:31.575 --> 00:15:33.645
Then you showed up out of the blue, saying you were starting a business.

00:15:34.105 --> 00:15:35.405
You even turned down my investment.

00:15:38.175 --> 00:15:39.215
Fine.

00:15:39.945 --> 00:15:43.555
I figured you'd tell me in due time. So I waited.

00:15:46.085 --> 00:15:47.085
But...

00:15:48.285 --> 00:15:50.255
you moved your office without even telling me.

00:15:51.355 --> 00:15:52.965
What do you take me for?

00:15:54.195 --> 00:15:55.795
Do you even consider me a friend?

00:16:00.035 --> 00:16:01.235
What is this, some kind of soap opera?

00:16:02.665 --> 00:16:04.805
Why are you so demanding and full of complaints?

00:16:06.605 --> 00:16:08.075
What's your definition of a friend, anyway?

00:16:09.005 --> 00:16:10.045
What does that even mean to you?

00:16:10.875 --> 00:16:11.975
Why do I have to be...

00:16:11.975 --> 00:16:14.045
the kind of friend you expect me to be?

00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:18.215
Lee Ji Hyuk.

00:16:18.915 --> 00:16:19.955
Take that back.

00:16:20.385 --> 00:16:21.485
Take what back?

00:16:23.325 --> 00:16:25.425
That we're not as close as you think?

00:16:25.425 --> 00:16:26.665
Should I take that back?

00:16:31.135 --> 00:16:33.465
You just called me here to see if I have feelings for Ji Eun Oh.

00:16:34.765 --> 00:16:36.005
Don't give me that friendship talk.

00:16:36.775 --> 00:16:38.275
As if you think of me as a real friend.

00:16:46.845 --> 00:16:49.285
Hey, say that again.

00:16:49.985 --> 00:16:51.055
Say that again!

00:16:57.955 --> 00:16:59.155
You want to know why I never said anything?

00:16:59.965 --> 00:17:01.465
Why I couldn't say anything?

00:17:02.695 --> 00:17:04.735
Because you ditched me first, you jerk!

00:17:08.605 --> 00:17:10.035
You were the one who ditched me.

00:17:11.435 --> 00:17:13.445
When you came to see me in the ER,

00:17:15.445 --> 00:17:16.915
you left without saying a single word.

00:17:18.375 --> 00:17:20.245
You didn't comfort me. You didn't even get mad.

00:17:21.245 --> 00:17:22.645
You just showed up silently after you got the call,

00:17:24.285 --> 00:17:25.955
paid my hospital bill, bought me a meal,

00:17:26.725 --> 00:17:29.755
and left after secretly stuffing a thousand dollars in my pocket!

00:17:32.425 --> 00:17:33.725
I didn't do anything.

00:17:34.465 --> 00:17:36.325
You'll come back when you hear from the company...

00:17:37.495 --> 00:17:38.635
you applied to, won't you?

00:17:39.265 --> 00:17:40.705
You just figured I'd get another job...

00:17:41.435 --> 00:17:43.905
and go back to my pathetic old life, and that was that.

00:17:45.175 --> 00:17:46.875
You were thinking, "Hurry up and face reality."

00:17:47.345 --> 00:17:49.005
"Get a job and live small."

00:17:50.475 --> 00:17:51.675
You thought so, but you bit your tongue.

00:17:52.975 --> 00:17:54.115
My marriage,

00:17:54.685 --> 00:17:56.045
my choice...

00:17:57.185 --> 00:17:58.585
You condemned it from the very beginning.

00:17:59.585 --> 00:18:00.985
So you thought, "That serves you right, you fool."

00:18:01.725 --> 00:18:03.025
And not saying those words out loud...

00:18:03.755 --> 00:18:06.355
You thought it was a big courtesy you could offer.

00:18:08.395 --> 00:18:09.735
Your friend, Lee Ji Hyuk...

00:18:11.265 --> 00:18:12.265
You never wondered...

00:18:13.905 --> 00:18:16.675
what he was going through when he chose to marry Jung Bo A.

00:18:19.335 --> 00:18:20.505
You never even thought to ask.

00:18:21.445 --> 00:18:23.675
You didn't care to know, and you never intended to listen.

00:18:30.715 --> 00:18:32.415
That's how you ditched me.

00:18:33.255 --> 00:18:35.325
So what was I supposed to tell you? How could I confide in you?

00:18:36.895 --> 00:18:39.725
And I'm meant to call you a friend? You jerk!

00:19:37.915 --> 00:19:39.485
You can't even throw a punch,

00:19:41.155 --> 00:19:42.555
and you thought you could take me on?

00:19:43.255 --> 00:19:44.655
If you feel so wronged, go on and say it.

00:19:45.295 --> 00:19:46.695
I had no idea.

00:19:50.695 --> 00:19:52.035
Yes. You're right.

00:19:53.865 --> 00:19:55.435
That's what I thought back then.

00:19:57.475 --> 00:19:58.975
I'm sorry, Ji Hyuk.

00:20:00.875 --> 00:20:02.075
You must have been so lonely.

00:20:12.055 --> 00:20:13.255
Don't make me get all emotional.

00:20:13.885 --> 00:20:14.885
After all this time?

00:20:17.125 --> 00:20:18.155
Get up.

00:20:24.465 --> 00:20:25.795
You wouldn't know this, but...

00:20:28.005 --> 00:20:30.305
I never had the time to come and chew you out like this.

00:20:32.275 --> 00:20:33.275
I...

00:20:35.275 --> 00:20:36.615
I had to survive.

00:20:37.915 --> 00:20:38.915
I know.

00:20:40.645 --> 00:20:42.085
I know how hard it must've been for you...

00:20:43.415 --> 00:20:44.955
since you came back to Seoul.

00:20:48.825 --> 00:20:49.855
So, are we good now?

00:20:51.095 --> 00:20:52.125
Satisfied?

00:20:57.335 --> 00:20:58.465
It's a huge relief.

00:21:00.005 --> 00:21:01.635
I should've just picked a fight with you sooner...

00:21:02.905 --> 00:21:04.635
so we could've had it out properly.

00:21:05.435 --> 00:21:06.475
Whatever.

00:21:08.245 --> 00:21:09.745
Come on, get up.

00:21:21.985 --> 00:21:23.055
But hey, Seong Jae.

00:21:24.455 --> 00:21:25.495
My gosh.

00:21:25.825 --> 00:21:27.965
What's with the serious tone? You're scaring me.

00:21:29.625 --> 00:21:32.435
Why have you been working so hard at the company lately?

00:21:33.835 --> 00:21:35.205
Working late every night...

00:21:36.635 --> 00:21:38.375
The look in your eyes has changed. You've got this new energy.

00:21:39.575 --> 00:21:43.315
The you I knew was just a guy stuck working at his father's company.

00:21:44.315 --> 00:21:45.345
Like you?

00:21:46.545 --> 00:21:49.015
Like you, who I thought would be a company man for life.

00:21:52.015 --> 00:21:53.325
You were living the same way I was.

00:21:53.755 --> 00:21:54.755
Without any dreams.

00:21:55.755 --> 00:21:58.125
What, are you saying you have a dream now?

00:21:59.455 --> 00:22:00.495
Yes.

00:22:02.895 --> 00:22:03.895
It's Eun Oh.

00:22:06.065 --> 00:22:07.065
What?

00:22:08.305 --> 00:22:09.865
I'm going to try and win her over.

00:22:10.305 --> 00:22:12.505
Hey, have you lost your mind?

00:22:14.305 --> 00:22:17.075
Have you forgotten how your family ruined your last marriage?

00:22:17.375 --> 00:22:18.375
I mean,

00:22:18.845 --> 00:22:20.185
they'll be even worse this time.

00:22:20.845 --> 00:22:22.615
They'll even bring up the fact that she was adopted.

00:22:23.755 --> 00:22:25.085
You and Eun Oh can never be together.

00:22:25.085 --> 00:22:26.285
I've told you a million times.

00:22:27.655 --> 00:22:29.995
Do you really think your parents will just leave her alone?

00:22:30.795 --> 00:22:33.595
- I'll keep them away from her. - How? How will you do that?

00:22:33.765 --> 00:22:34.825
At the company,

00:22:35.565 --> 00:22:37.435
I'm going to make myself completely indispensable.

00:22:38.095 --> 00:22:39.935
So that my father can't function without me.

00:22:41.505 --> 00:22:42.535
And then,

00:22:43.975 --> 00:22:45.405
I'm going to tell Eun Oh how I feel.

00:22:48.045 --> 00:22:50.345
So you're building up leverage to go against your father?

00:22:51.175 --> 00:22:52.215
Yes.

00:22:53.585 --> 00:22:55.785
So if Ji Eun Oh takes my hand,

00:22:56.445 --> 00:22:58.315
my father won't be able to tear us apart.

00:23:01.155 --> 00:23:04.395
Why did I listen to you nine years ago?

00:23:05.525 --> 00:23:07.495
Why couldn't I think like this back then?

00:23:09.325 --> 00:23:10.335
If I had,

00:23:11.635 --> 00:23:13.335
I could have avoided that marriage altogether.

00:23:14.865 --> 00:23:17.935
Right, I was married. Very short-lived, though.

00:23:18.475 --> 00:23:19.675
But you see,

00:23:20.345 --> 00:23:22.345
after she knows everything, the choice...

00:23:22.645 --> 00:23:23.675
is up to Eun Oh.

00:23:24.975 --> 00:23:26.415
And another thing, Ji Hyuk.

00:23:27.515 --> 00:23:28.885
You no longer...

00:23:29.245 --> 00:23:31.455
have any right or say in this matter.

00:23:32.215 --> 00:23:34.225
Because Eun Oh doesn't consider you her senior anymore.

00:23:38.895 --> 00:23:39.925
What?

00:23:40.195 --> 00:23:41.725
Do you have nothing to say?

00:23:42.595 --> 00:23:43.595
Are you surprised?

00:23:47.035 --> 00:23:48.805
Wouldn't you be?

00:23:49.665 --> 00:23:52.205
You've really changed, Park Seong Jae.

00:23:53.645 --> 00:23:55.705
So? Are you going to root for me?

00:24:01.345 --> 00:24:02.415
Yes, good luck.

00:24:05.885 --> 00:24:07.425
Let's go. You said you were busy.

00:24:13.125 --> 00:24:15.325
Of all the places to meet, it had to be a dirt patch?

00:24:16.065 --> 00:24:19.095
Hey. How embarrassing is this?

00:24:19.665 --> 00:24:21.135
Who do you think is more embarrassed?

00:24:21.535 --> 00:24:23.605
Please. I'm the one who's more embarrassed.

00:24:23.805 --> 00:24:28.475
Do you think more of your staff walk by here or mine?

00:24:28.675 --> 00:24:32.075
You inherited your company, and I founded mine, you punk.

00:24:34.685 --> 00:24:37.415
Right. Thanks to you,

00:24:37.615 --> 00:24:39.585
I'm an angel investor now.

00:24:40.485 --> 00:24:41.485
You invested?

00:24:41.555 --> 00:24:43.755
I joined Sunny Investment Group because of you, remember?

00:24:44.325 --> 00:24:45.555
So I made another one while I was at it.

00:24:46.625 --> 00:24:48.825
It's pretty fun to watch.

00:24:50.965 --> 00:24:53.395
That's unexpected, Park Seong Jae.

00:24:55.535 --> 00:24:56.535
Let's go.

00:25:13.485 --> 00:25:16.025
Why are you calling me "Hey?" We're partners.

00:25:16.825 --> 00:25:19.855
He used to be so shamelessly friendly.

00:25:21.125 --> 00:25:23.025
Ms. Ji, you're here too.

00:25:24.595 --> 00:25:27.005
You can just talk to Mr. Jo about that.

00:25:33.975 --> 00:25:37.715
Mr. Lee, by any chance, did I do something to upset you?

00:25:38.075 --> 00:25:39.775
(Lee Ji Hyuk)

00:25:47.625 --> 00:25:49.155
No, not at all.

00:25:50.625 --> 00:25:51.755
See? This is what I'm talking about.

00:25:52.095 --> 00:25:54.765
I didn't do anything wrong. So, why is he being like this to me?

00:25:57.035 --> 00:25:58.165
Eun Oh.

00:26:01.305 --> 00:26:02.465
Why the long face?

00:26:05.835 --> 00:26:09.505
- Ji Hyuk's suddenly acting weird. - Weird how?

00:26:09.605 --> 00:26:12.945
He's giving me the cold shoulder, I guess?

00:26:13.215 --> 00:26:16.445
He's acting so weird around me. He was fine just the other day.

00:26:16.845 --> 00:26:19.255
I guess he's finally had enough of you.

00:26:19.885 --> 00:26:21.625
Me? What do you mean?

00:26:21.755 --> 00:26:25.055
After he came back, you gave him a hard time.

00:26:25.125 --> 00:26:26.125
Don't you remember?

00:26:27.895 --> 00:26:29.425
But he deserved it back then.

00:26:29.925 --> 00:26:32.965
Right. That's what you might think.

00:26:34.135 --> 00:26:36.465
But honestly, every once in a while,

00:26:36.535 --> 00:26:40.375
I thought you were a little harsh, which is unlike you.

00:26:41.475 --> 00:26:42.645
I see.

00:26:56.025 --> 00:26:58.495
So it's your turn today, Mr. Park?

00:26:59.195 --> 00:27:04.035
I told you I'd do it from now on. Ji Hyuk can be such a prankster.

00:27:04.965 --> 00:27:06.765
I'll only need a ride through this week.

00:27:07.135 --> 00:27:09.935
I've been a burden because of my injured hand.

00:27:09.935 --> 00:27:11.605
I can't use my left hand right now.

00:27:11.935 --> 00:27:15.275
I said I'd carpool with you until the mugger is caught.

00:27:15.575 --> 00:27:19.975
The mugger was in this cafe, right? Not my neighbourhood.

00:27:21.115 --> 00:27:22.885
Right. I forgot about that.

00:27:23.115 --> 00:27:27.125
And I have a whistle, pepper spray, and even a taser.

00:27:27.255 --> 00:27:29.685
I'm fully armed, so I'm not scared at all.

00:27:32.655 --> 00:27:34.525
Let's just get in the car, Ms. Ji Eun Oh.

00:27:35.665 --> 00:27:36.765
"Ms. Ji Eun Oh?"

00:27:37.265 --> 00:27:40.195
You're not technically my junior anyway.

00:27:41.565 --> 00:27:43.065
Hurry and get in.

00:27:43.905 --> 00:27:45.735

(Gaon Foundation)

00:28:02.425 --> 00:28:05.695
This three-seater sofa is nice,

00:28:05.925 --> 00:28:08.895
but what if all three of them want to rest at the same time?

00:28:11.535 --> 00:28:13.935
I hadn't considered that.

00:28:14.665 --> 00:28:19.205
I'd like individual rest areas next to each artist's workspace.

00:28:19.635 --> 00:28:22.705
So they can relax in an armchair with their feet up on a stool.

00:28:23.005 --> 00:28:26.315
There are beds, but the bedroom area can feel confining.

00:28:27.985 --> 00:28:31.785
You're being so considerate of the artists.

00:28:32.415 --> 00:28:34.025
I'd really love that,

00:28:34.025 --> 00:28:36.125
but the space is a little tight, isn't it?

00:28:36.455 --> 00:28:38.855
Not necessarily. Let me take another look.

00:28:38.925 --> 00:28:41.365
It won't be easy, but I'll give it a shot.

00:28:41.525 --> 00:28:42.995
Then I'll count on you.

00:28:46.335 --> 00:28:48.305
Director Ko, by any chance...

00:28:48.365 --> 00:28:51.635
Could I get the contact info for all three artists?

00:28:51.835 --> 00:28:55.575
- I want to know their tastes... - Absolutely not.

00:28:57.475 --> 00:28:59.645
This is meant to be a surprise.

00:29:02.715 --> 00:29:04.655
You're right, Ms. Ji,

00:29:04.655 --> 00:29:06.615
but if people know about it in advance,

00:29:06.685 --> 00:29:08.555
they'll start to get their hopes up.

00:29:08.825 --> 00:29:11.255
Do you know how nasty hope can be?

00:29:11.555 --> 00:29:13.595
They'll think, "I wish they'd do this."

00:29:13.695 --> 00:29:15.425
Then they'll ask, "Can't you do it like that?"

00:29:15.765 --> 00:29:19.565
That leads to friction and conflict. Between you and them, Eun Oh.

00:29:22.035 --> 00:29:24.235
They'll think you're doing it your way.

00:29:24.435 --> 00:29:26.575
They could even think you're selfish.

00:29:27.905 --> 00:29:32.415
No, not at all. After hearing you out,

00:29:32.475 --> 00:29:34.115
everything you said makes perfect sense.

00:29:36.045 --> 00:29:40.685
Let's put our hearts into this and create the best space we can.

00:29:41.055 --> 00:29:42.885
Yes, I understand.

00:29:44.095 --> 00:29:45.095
You know, right?

00:29:45.625 --> 00:29:46.925
No rushing.

00:29:47.795 --> 00:29:48.865
Got it.

00:29:50.325 --> 00:29:52.195
I should be on my way.

00:29:52.735 --> 00:29:54.405
Wait a second.

00:29:55.065 --> 00:29:57.475
Can you spare me just five more minutes?

00:29:58.705 --> 00:29:59.705
Pardon?

00:30:01.005 --> 00:30:03.005
You just remind me of someone.

00:30:04.245 --> 00:30:06.445
Sometimes your face, Ms. Ji...

00:30:06.445 --> 00:30:08.815
It's like a mirror of someone else.

00:30:11.355 --> 00:30:13.185
I don't know if you really look like her,

00:30:13.585 --> 00:30:16.655
or if my own longing is just creating an illusion.

00:30:18.795 --> 00:30:22.765
For today, I just want to look at you in silence.

00:30:23.525 --> 00:30:24.965
If you don't mind the imposition.

00:30:29.035 --> 00:30:30.035
Okay.

00:30:34.705 --> 00:30:37.875
I need to work on something alone, so I'm going to work elsewhere.

00:30:38.675 --> 00:30:41.115
I'm going to stop by the Hyunmyeong Apartments site too.

00:30:42.285 --> 00:30:44.555
You'll have some peace and quiet now.

00:30:44.555 --> 00:30:46.055
It's always quiet.

00:30:50.455 --> 00:30:52.425
- Hello. - Hello.

00:30:53.125 --> 00:30:54.125
One iced Americano, please.

00:30:54.295 --> 00:30:57.065
Sure. Min Woo, one iced Americano.

00:30:57.265 --> 00:30:58.765
- Got it. - To go?

00:30:58.765 --> 00:30:59.935
No.

00:31:02.905 --> 00:31:06.405
- Hey, where's my boss? - You mean Ji Hyuk?

00:31:06.705 --> 00:31:07.775
He hasn't been in.

00:31:08.205 --> 00:31:10.975
- He left to work in peace. - Really?

00:31:11.675 --> 00:31:12.875
Then why hasn't he shown up?

00:31:28.165 --> 00:31:29.565
Mr. Lee Ji Hyuk?

00:31:32.395 --> 00:31:33.395
Let's talk outside.

00:31:39.275 --> 00:31:40.275
How did she find me?

00:31:55.225 --> 00:31:57.595
Wait, how did you know I was here?

00:31:58.395 --> 00:32:01.095
I should be asking you that. Why are you here?

00:32:02.195 --> 00:32:03.195
Seriously.

00:32:04.165 --> 00:32:05.665
What's gotten into you?

00:32:07.035 --> 00:32:09.435
What are you talking about? What do you mean?

00:32:09.635 --> 00:32:13.005
You said I didn't do anything wrong. So why are you acting like this?

00:32:13.075 --> 00:32:14.675
Would you care to explain?

00:32:16.005 --> 00:32:17.675
I should be asking you the same thing, Ms. Ji.

00:32:18.845 --> 00:32:20.115
Did I do something wrong?

00:32:20.715 --> 00:32:23.615
No, you've just become weird. You're making me uncomfortable.

00:32:24.215 --> 00:32:26.555
Like right now. Why are you at this cafe?

00:32:28.755 --> 00:32:30.455
What's the big deal about me being here?

00:32:31.755 --> 00:32:33.925
Look, if I go to Cafe Agit, it's too familiar,

00:32:34.295 --> 00:32:36.395
and I'll just end up slacking off.

00:32:36.925 --> 00:32:38.235
That's why I came to a different cafe.

00:32:49.605 --> 00:32:52.075
Is that supposed to be your excuse?

00:32:55.615 --> 00:32:57.455
You can't focus in unfamiliar places.

00:32:58.555 --> 00:33:01.055
Look. We've known each other for years.

00:33:01.125 --> 00:33:02.585
You think I wouldn't know that about you?

00:33:03.425 --> 00:33:05.925
We've known each other as senior and junior for ten years.

00:33:10.025 --> 00:33:11.035
"Senior?"

00:33:14.465 --> 00:33:15.465
Really?

00:33:20.075 --> 00:33:21.805
I'm asking you to treat me like a business partner.

00:33:22.605 --> 00:33:24.315
Just like when you first proposed we work together,

00:33:24.845 --> 00:33:26.875
and like you did when we started out as partners.

00:33:28.185 --> 00:33:30.515
You'd barge in even when I said no.

00:33:30.515 --> 00:33:31.915
Politely put, you were being forward,

00:33:32.115 --> 00:33:33.655
but honestly, you were just being shameless.

00:33:34.455 --> 00:33:35.655
Why are you playing dumb now?

00:33:43.625 --> 00:33:45.835
I thought you didn't like talking to me, Ms. Ji Eun Oh.

00:33:46.865 --> 00:33:48.865
You're getting what you wanted, so what's the problem?

00:33:48.935 --> 00:33:52.735
I didn't like making small talk. But this is about work.

00:33:53.505 --> 00:33:56.745
Then why did you pester me so much back then?

00:33:57.305 --> 00:34:00.645
I told you that I despised you, and to pretend you didn't know me.

00:34:00.715 --> 00:34:02.485
I even said we should be complete strangers.

00:34:02.785 --> 00:34:05.385
So why were you so persistent back then?

00:34:05.715 --> 00:34:06.715
You know how to hit where it hurts,

00:34:07.385 --> 00:34:08.385
Ms. Ji Eun Oh.

00:34:10.525 --> 00:34:13.055
If I'd known you were going to be this hot and cold,

00:34:13.525 --> 00:34:15.295
I never would've gone into business with you.

00:34:16.865 --> 00:34:17.965
You said you'd be professional about this.

00:34:20.335 --> 00:34:21.335
No, it's just...

00:34:22.805 --> 00:34:25.275
I just have a lot on my plate with the company right now.

00:34:27.545 --> 00:34:28.545
Whatever.

00:34:29.105 --> 00:34:31.515
Be at the cafe tomorrow at 10am for our meeting.

00:34:32.145 --> 00:34:33.815
If you're not there, I'm coming to your office.

00:34:34.115 --> 00:34:37.755
Actually, I have plans tomorrow. I'm going to be completely swamped.

00:34:38.185 --> 00:34:41.285
If you have anything to discuss, you can just talk to Mr. Jo.

00:34:44.225 --> 00:34:45.225
So we're back to square one.

00:34:46.695 --> 00:34:47.725
I'm just busy with work, so...

00:34:48.225 --> 00:34:49.225
I have to go.

00:34:53.095 --> 00:34:54.705
Why is he so hot and cold?

00:34:56.535 --> 00:34:57.675
I'm starting to dislike him all over again.

00:34:57.975 --> 00:34:58.975
What's with her?

00:35:08.285 --> 00:35:09.345
That's 150 dollars.

00:35:09.785 --> 00:35:10.785
Please check the amount.

00:35:12.315 --> 00:35:13.355
This money...

00:35:13.855 --> 00:35:15.655
I saved it up from my part-time job.

00:35:17.025 --> 00:35:19.655
I'm withdrawing it to buy my son some nice beef ribs...

00:35:19.655 --> 00:35:20.865
for his birthday.

00:35:20.925 --> 00:35:23.495
- You have a part-time job, ma'am? - I do.

00:35:24.265 --> 00:35:28.165
I asked him, "Have you seen anyone my age with a part-time job?"

00:35:28.365 --> 00:35:30.905
He said, "You're the first one," and looked so surprised.

00:35:33.775 --> 00:35:35.805
You must have been so proud, Ok Rye.

00:35:37.275 --> 00:35:39.915
Anyway, why did you take out so much money all of a sudden?

00:35:40.815 --> 00:35:43.845
I'm going to make my son prime beef ribs for his birthday.

00:35:44.885 --> 00:35:48.355
- And I'm buying you lunch, Jang Su. - What? Me?

00:35:48.685 --> 00:35:51.725
We're friends, aren't we? And now, we're coworkers too.

00:35:52.155 --> 00:35:54.165
Plus, you've bought me so many snacks.

00:35:55.525 --> 00:35:57.695
Is there anything you're in the mood for?

00:35:58.295 --> 00:35:59.695
It's my treat.

00:36:03.235 --> 00:36:04.405
Well...

00:36:06.535 --> 00:36:09.845
There's something I want to try, but I'm too embarrassed to go alone.

00:36:16.815 --> 00:36:19.985
I mean, I can go to a soup place or a diner by myself,

00:36:20.585 --> 00:36:23.885
but for some reason, I can't get tteokbokki and fried snacks alone.

00:36:26.025 --> 00:36:29.025
It tastes even better eating it with money I earned myself.

00:36:29.525 --> 00:36:30.965
I know exactly what you mean.

00:36:32.995 --> 00:36:36.635
- Mr. Kim. - Hey now, we're friends.

00:36:37.265 --> 00:36:38.975
Oh, goodness. All right, then.

00:36:40.805 --> 00:36:41.805
Jang Su.

00:36:43.005 --> 00:36:45.815
When do you think we'll finally be able to leave this world?

00:36:47.585 --> 00:36:52.015
Everyone lives to be 100 these days. Just look at my appetite.

00:36:52.715 --> 00:36:54.155
And I have no problem digesting, either.

00:36:55.855 --> 00:36:56.855
Ok Rye.

00:36:57.855 --> 00:36:59.195
Do you want to move on?

00:36:59.995 --> 00:37:00.995
I don't really know.

00:37:02.425 --> 00:37:04.965
They say any kind of life is worth living,

00:37:06.135 --> 00:37:09.065
and I don't think I actually want to go,

00:37:10.035 --> 00:37:11.875
but I keep feeling like it's my time.

00:37:13.235 --> 00:37:15.675
Well, that's because we feel so useless.

00:37:17.945 --> 00:37:18.945
More and more,

00:37:20.145 --> 00:37:21.845
we just become a burden on our kids.

00:37:24.355 --> 00:37:25.355
Sometimes, I...

00:37:26.455 --> 00:37:30.855
"Why am I still hanging on?" I sometimes ask myself that.

00:37:32.095 --> 00:37:33.095
I don't know how...

00:37:33.925 --> 00:37:36.065
it came to be like this.

00:37:36.665 --> 00:37:39.065
It used to be that dying at 80 was considered a blessing.

00:37:39.165 --> 00:37:40.635
My goodness.

00:37:41.105 --> 00:37:42.965
Enough with this morbid talk.

00:37:43.635 --> 00:37:46.635
Anyway, when are you planning to tell Sang Cheol?

00:37:47.335 --> 00:37:49.475
After he gets a job.

00:37:49.875 --> 00:37:53.045
Then I'll tell him I want to earn my own spending money.

00:37:53.115 --> 00:37:55.215
And that he shouldn't try to stop me. That's my plan.

00:37:57.585 --> 00:37:58.955
As for me...

00:38:00.155 --> 00:38:04.025
When I save up enough money for a year-long trip,

00:38:06.255 --> 00:38:07.795
I'll go to the US to see my son...

00:38:08.425 --> 00:38:11.135
and spend a year with my grandkids before coming back.

00:38:12.365 --> 00:38:15.405
That way, I won't need to take money from Da Jeong for living expenses,

00:38:15.765 --> 00:38:20.175
and when I get back, I'll tell her to stop giving me money.

00:38:21.145 --> 00:38:25.215
Between my pension and the cash I make on the side,

00:38:26.415 --> 00:38:29.485
I think I'll have enough to get by.

00:38:30.385 --> 00:38:31.755
Our children...

00:38:32.855 --> 00:38:34.925
Because of both sets of parents,

00:38:36.085 --> 00:38:38.025
they've had to work so hard.

00:38:43.265 --> 00:38:46.595
- Yes, enjoy your meal. - Thank you.

00:38:47.235 --> 00:38:49.065
- Enjoy. - Enjoy.

00:38:49.205 --> 00:38:51.435
- Excuse me. More kimchi, please. - Yes.

00:38:53.775 --> 00:38:56.105
If you rush with the PE and CD pipes...

00:38:56.105 --> 00:38:58.275
and don't fasten this metal connector,

00:38:58.345 --> 00:39:00.515
you'll be disqualified automatically,

00:39:00.515 --> 00:39:01.585
so be careful.

00:39:06.655 --> 00:39:07.655
Honey.

00:39:09.825 --> 00:39:12.825
The day after tomorrow, come straight home after your class.

00:39:13.395 --> 00:39:14.725
It's your birthday.

00:39:15.495 --> 00:39:18.165
Ji Hyuk's back now, so we should have dinner together.

00:39:18.165 --> 00:39:22.435
- My birthday? - Yes, it's my husband's birthday.

00:39:23.135 --> 00:39:24.135
But that's on Thursday.

00:39:24.835 --> 00:39:28.875
Also, I'm in no position to be celebrating my birthday.

00:39:29.105 --> 00:39:30.375
Let's just skip it this year.

00:39:30.945 --> 00:39:31.975
That's ridiculous.

00:39:32.445 --> 00:39:33.445
But Ji Hyuk's here...

00:39:33.445 --> 00:39:35.645
Gosh, it's always Ji Hyuk with you.

00:39:36.345 --> 00:39:38.615
Is he even here as our son? He's just an empty shell.

00:39:38.955 --> 00:39:41.825
What? I'm not eating at the same table as that punk.

00:39:43.285 --> 00:39:47.125
Besides, I'm not celebrating until I find a new job.

00:39:47.555 --> 00:39:50.265
Honey, Ji Hyuk is our son.

00:39:52.565 --> 00:39:54.765
You call that a son?

00:39:55.935 --> 00:39:57.405
Do you even know what he's up to?

00:39:58.775 --> 00:40:01.175
Then what about breakfast together?

00:40:01.505 --> 00:40:04.045
I have a special lecture that morning at 7am.

00:40:04.475 --> 00:40:06.345
Can't you skip it just this once?

00:40:07.415 --> 00:40:09.445
The exam is right around the corner.

00:40:12.655 --> 00:40:13.715
Stubborn as a mule.

00:40:15.385 --> 00:40:16.385
I'm home.

00:40:17.685 --> 00:40:18.695
Hey, you.

00:40:19.995 --> 00:40:22.095
Dad says he's skipping his birthday this year.

00:40:23.295 --> 00:40:24.795
Until he gets a new job,

00:40:25.395 --> 00:40:26.635
he says he won't celebrate.

00:40:26.995 --> 00:40:29.865
That's just Dad. His sense of responsibility is too strong.

00:40:30.905 --> 00:40:31.905
What about you, Mom?

00:40:34.135 --> 00:40:36.145
Let's just do as your father wishes.

00:40:37.705 --> 00:40:38.715
All right, then.

00:40:39.475 --> 00:40:41.185
The most important thing is how the birthday boy feels.

00:41:04.605 --> 00:41:05.605
(No! What is that?)

00:41:05.675 --> 00:41:07.035
(A monster? That's so harsh.)

00:41:11.615 --> 00:41:12.645
Ms. Park!

00:41:13.215 --> 00:41:15.015
I'm about to burst.

00:41:16.715 --> 00:41:18.515
I can't wait any longer, okay?

00:41:18.855 --> 00:41:19.855
Come on, please.

00:41:21.355 --> 00:41:22.585
Okay, I'm coming out now.

00:41:32.165 --> 00:41:33.165
Gosh, finally...

00:41:36.705 --> 00:41:37.705
I'm sorry.

00:41:43.075 --> 00:41:45.175
(Message)

00:41:46.245 --> 00:41:48.185
I'm cancelling our plans for tomorrow.

00:41:48.515 --> 00:41:49.515
What?

00:42:07.335 --> 00:42:09.365
Director Ko, you have an unexpected visitor.

00:42:09.635 --> 00:42:10.805
What? Who?

00:42:16.445 --> 00:42:18.345
As expected. You recognise me right away.

00:42:19.245 --> 00:42:22.245
You were rude, so I thought I'd return the favour.

00:42:23.315 --> 00:42:25.915
I figured I could just come in without an invitation.

00:42:28.325 --> 00:42:29.325
And I was right.

00:42:31.355 --> 00:42:32.925
Excuse me, ma'am.

00:42:42.335 --> 00:42:44.105
Just who do you think you're playing?

00:42:44.435 --> 00:42:48.175
You found out my son had returned, figured out which gym he goes to,

00:42:48.245 --> 00:42:50.975
and then signed your daughter up for a membership right on cue.

00:42:52.215 --> 00:42:55.145
Ms. Lee Mo Ran of Hyeonyu Group, right?

00:42:56.385 --> 00:42:59.455
Whether Hyeonyu's heir is dating or just playing around,

00:42:59.755 --> 00:43:01.985
did you think he'd defy his parents to see a woman?

00:43:02.855 --> 00:43:04.725
Your daughter's been contacted by now.

00:43:04.725 --> 00:43:06.325
By my Jung Ho, personally.

00:43:07.125 --> 00:43:08.865
There's nothing more to discuss.

00:43:09.525 --> 00:43:11.795
To think you'd resort to scheming like this...

00:43:12.465 --> 00:43:14.905
I'd rather not dirty my mouth over it, so I'll bury it here.

00:43:15.635 --> 00:43:17.135
So let's just stay out of each other's way.

00:43:46.765 --> 00:43:50.565
Mom, I just heard from Min Jung Ho. He cancelled our plans.

00:43:51.505 --> 00:43:53.305
So, what now?

00:43:54.375 --> 00:43:56.205
What do you mean, "What now?"

00:43:57.375 --> 00:43:59.445
You should have done a better job!

00:44:08.855 --> 00:44:10.685
I'm on my way. You?

00:44:12.055 --> 00:44:13.055
Shoot!

00:44:27.275 --> 00:44:29.075
The sushi here is always so good.

00:44:30.845 --> 00:44:33.515
So, how did you get so into sushi?

00:44:33.515 --> 00:44:35.545
There's so much other delicious food.

00:44:37.015 --> 00:44:40.685
It's tied to the memory of the most delicious meal of my life.

00:44:40.685 --> 00:44:41.725
A memory?

00:44:44.225 --> 00:44:45.925
In that case, for me...

00:44:46.495 --> 00:44:49.425
It'd be the black sesame porridge you brought me in a thermos.

00:44:50.795 --> 00:44:51.795
Sesame porridge?

00:44:52.235 --> 00:44:54.035
Come on, you're exaggerating.

00:44:54.495 --> 00:44:56.565
You grew up eating the finest foods in the world.

00:44:57.305 --> 00:44:58.305
But if we're talking about memories.

00:44:59.735 --> 00:45:03.875
I'd been sick with this awful flu that went on for a month.

00:45:04.545 --> 00:45:07.645
That day, on that snowy road, out on the street...

00:45:08.985 --> 00:45:11.285
I wish you'd never seen me.

00:45:12.585 --> 00:45:13.585
What are you talking about?

00:45:16.855 --> 00:45:18.955
I was looking into marriage matches for Seong Jae,

00:45:19.825 --> 00:45:21.495
but a family at the level of Hyeonyu Group...

00:45:23.395 --> 00:45:24.425
seems to be out of the question.

00:45:25.935 --> 00:45:28.465
Of course, Hyeonyu Group is a long shot.

00:45:28.905 --> 00:45:30.505
Seong Jae comes with some baggage, you know.

00:45:31.505 --> 00:45:32.905
You've already looked that deep into it?

00:45:33.875 --> 00:45:36.345
Seong Jae may have made a misstep,

00:45:36.705 --> 00:45:38.345
but he's the eldest son and our heir.

00:45:38.345 --> 00:45:40.115
And he's incredibly handsome.

00:45:40.475 --> 00:45:42.085
He's tall and well-educated.

00:45:43.615 --> 00:45:46.255
Business people focus on profit.

00:45:46.255 --> 00:45:48.015
If he found a girlfriend, it'd be different,

00:45:48.355 --> 00:45:49.385
but you need to lower your standards.

00:45:50.655 --> 00:45:51.655
And you, honey...

00:45:52.555 --> 00:45:56.125
It's time you let go of that inferiority complex.

00:45:56.665 --> 00:46:00.565
You've been my wife for years now. Why do you still feel guilty?

00:46:00.635 --> 00:46:01.635
Please.

00:46:02.635 --> 00:46:03.635
That's not it at all.

00:46:05.335 --> 00:46:06.675
In fact, sometimes...

00:46:07.505 --> 00:46:08.645
You might think...

00:46:08.645 --> 00:46:10.645
I'm a terrible person for saying this,

00:46:12.645 --> 00:46:15.415
but I actually feel grateful to her at times.

00:46:16.615 --> 00:46:17.615
What?

00:46:18.185 --> 00:46:19.655
If it weren't for her,

00:46:20.985 --> 00:46:24.485
how would I have met a man like you and fallen in love?

00:46:31.765 --> 00:46:34.035
(Shoealls)

00:46:38.035 --> 00:46:39.335
A foggy road

00:46:39.835 --> 00:46:40.835
Darn it.

00:46:49.145 --> 00:46:51.315
I'm telling you, I met him and just wasn't feeling it.

00:46:52.185 --> 00:46:55.825
Fine, whatever happened, let's get lunch and you can tell me.

00:46:56.585 --> 00:46:58.925
Seriously, you don't have to go to all this trouble.

00:46:59.795 --> 00:47:04.265
How can I not be concerned? He's the reason we're both here.

00:47:04.465 --> 00:47:07.665
Gosh, you're more overprotective than my actual older brother.

00:47:08.705 --> 00:47:11.905
Aren't you hungry? I'm starving from rushing over here.

00:47:12.175 --> 00:47:13.375
All right, fine. Let's go.

00:47:15.875 --> 00:47:16.875
- Oh, no... - What's wrong?

00:47:17.175 --> 00:47:18.175
It's Ji Hyuk.

00:47:20.145 --> 00:47:21.515
Ji Hyuk? What's he doing here?

00:47:21.645 --> 00:47:24.645
I don't know! What do we do? Quick, this way, hurry!

00:47:28.385 --> 00:47:29.425
Over here.

00:47:33.725 --> 00:47:34.825
Did you tell him?

00:47:35.095 --> 00:47:37.665
- No, I thought you called him. - Why would I do that?

00:47:37.895 --> 00:47:39.665
Then why is Ji Hyuk here?

00:47:39.735 --> 00:47:42.535
I have no idea. I felt like he'd grab me by the neck.

00:47:42.535 --> 00:47:44.205
I thought my heart was going to pound out of my chest.

00:47:48.575 --> 00:47:49.575
My gosh.

00:47:52.815 --> 00:47:54.845
Maybe he's here to get a gift for Dad?

00:47:54.845 --> 00:47:56.345
I was planning to get him something.

00:47:56.715 --> 00:47:57.715
Wait, my phone...

00:48:05.525 --> 00:48:06.525
Man.

00:48:07.055 --> 00:48:10.495
I guess we were really scared of Ji Hyuk.

00:48:10.965 --> 00:48:13.365
I'm so thirsty. Hey, you got a couple bucks?

00:48:14.135 --> 00:48:15.135
What?

00:48:17.205 --> 00:48:18.875
I like this one the best.

00:48:19.235 --> 00:48:20.235
It's lightweight too.

00:48:21.135 --> 00:48:22.905
So this is your favourite design, then?

00:48:23.145 --> 00:48:26.345
Yes. It's sleek, and it would suit my dad.

00:48:26.745 --> 00:48:28.845
- I'll take it. - Okay.

00:48:29.845 --> 00:48:32.455
I never thought I'd be eating street food at my age.

00:48:32.915 --> 00:48:33.915
But it's good, right?

00:48:33.985 --> 00:48:36.555
Yes. Seriously, what is this? It's amazing.

00:48:37.185 --> 00:48:39.795
You're silly. It tastes so good because you're starving.

00:48:39.855 --> 00:48:41.395
We didn't even eat lunch.

00:48:41.725 --> 00:48:42.825
Is that why?

00:48:43.665 --> 00:48:45.265
You're surprisingly cute.

00:48:47.535 --> 00:48:48.535
What?

00:48:49.105 --> 00:48:50.105
You little brat.

00:48:50.405 --> 00:48:52.005
Don't pull the age card on me.

00:48:52.975 --> 00:48:55.145
For all you know, I could marry a guy...

00:48:55.145 --> 00:48:56.875
ten years older than you.

00:48:57.045 --> 00:48:58.275
Shut it, you brat.

00:48:58.675 --> 00:48:59.945
I don't care what you think about it.

00:48:59.945 --> 00:49:01.215
There's no way I'll let you do that.

00:49:01.845 --> 00:49:02.885
And who are you to stop me?

00:49:03.585 --> 00:49:04.585
Me?

00:49:06.255 --> 00:49:07.255
I'm the one who looks out for you.

00:49:08.015 --> 00:49:09.655
Though I have no idea how that happened.

00:49:10.825 --> 00:49:12.795
So, why'd you get a divorce?

00:49:20.865 --> 00:49:22.335
You're awfully quiet today.

00:49:22.835 --> 00:49:23.835
What's wrong?

00:49:24.305 --> 00:49:26.505
Because I'm getting in big trouble with my mom.

00:49:26.635 --> 00:49:29.505
Why? Did she catch you reading comics?

00:49:30.545 --> 00:49:31.545
No.

00:49:34.445 --> 00:49:37.685
But let me borrow three more.

00:49:38.145 --> 00:49:39.155
I finished them all.

00:49:39.215 --> 00:49:42.255
Already? Hey, you're good at not being caught.

00:49:42.755 --> 00:49:44.585
My mom has to sleep too.

00:49:45.725 --> 00:49:50.625
Did you read them all night? You're going to get caught.

00:49:52.135 --> 00:49:54.665
You're the one who got me hooked on comics in the first place.

00:49:54.895 --> 00:49:57.005
That was just research...

00:49:57.005 --> 00:49:59.435
to help you finish "Take My Heart" faster.

00:50:00.805 --> 00:50:03.705
Although, I know exactly how you feel.

00:50:04.605 --> 00:50:05.815
You're dying to know what happens next, right?

00:50:06.975 --> 00:50:09.485
Yes. Desperately.

00:50:09.585 --> 00:50:11.145
Tell me about it.

00:50:11.545 --> 00:50:13.515
The wait for your next webtoon is killing me.

00:50:14.285 --> 00:50:18.525
Okay, here's the deal. Two of your episodes for one comic.

00:50:19.625 --> 00:50:20.625
Really?

00:50:22.865 --> 00:50:25.695
But mine isn't serialized like that.

00:50:26.065 --> 00:50:30.505
I already used my cliffhanger genius to slice it all up.

00:50:30.635 --> 00:50:31.635
I was bored.

00:50:46.985 --> 00:50:47.985
Mom.

00:50:51.925 --> 00:50:52.925
Do you have any idea...

00:50:53.425 --> 00:50:55.195
what I went through today?

00:51:00.235 --> 00:51:04.405
That's why I'm pushing you so hard to move up in the world.

00:51:06.975 --> 00:51:08.645
Because this world is built on class.

00:51:09.705 --> 00:51:10.705
That's why...

00:51:12.345 --> 00:51:13.815
we get treated like nothing.

00:51:16.715 --> 00:51:17.715
I'm sorry.

00:51:19.585 --> 00:51:22.025
Yeong Ra, when a man...

00:51:23.085 --> 00:51:24.555
falls for a woman,

00:51:25.395 --> 00:51:26.725
he stops listening to reason,

00:51:27.295 --> 00:51:31.735
tunes everything out, and can only see you.

00:51:32.395 --> 00:51:36.005
Of course, this phase doesn't last very long.

00:51:36.235 --> 00:51:39.035
That's why you have to do anything to make that happen fast.

00:51:41.005 --> 00:51:42.005
Okay.

00:51:44.775 --> 00:51:46.875
I should have taught you better.

00:51:48.375 --> 00:51:50.415
How am I ever going to teach you?

00:51:50.745 --> 00:51:52.085
It worked for me.

00:51:54.155 --> 00:51:55.255
I'm sorry.

00:52:22.945 --> 00:52:26.285
(Pow)

00:52:26.355 --> 00:52:29.455
(My old master sent me to serve you now.)

00:52:36.525 --> 00:52:37.995
You're late every day.

00:52:39.135 --> 00:52:40.995
Just sit tight. I'll leave you two to talk.

00:52:41.535 --> 00:52:43.865
Ji Hyuk was waiting for you.

00:52:44.835 --> 00:52:46.435
For me? Why?

00:52:47.135 --> 00:52:49.145
You said you wouldn't have time on your actual birthday.

00:52:49.675 --> 00:52:51.445
This is your birthday present.

00:52:52.015 --> 00:52:53.815
I thought you could use some comfortable shoes.

00:52:56.085 --> 00:52:58.115
Didn't I tell you I wanted to skip my birthday this year?

00:52:59.115 --> 00:53:01.385
I thought you just meant you didn't want a birthday dinner.

00:53:02.855 --> 00:53:04.085
Fine, just leave it there.

00:53:04.825 --> 00:53:05.925
Let's open it.

00:53:06.395 --> 00:53:07.395
Here.

00:53:11.065 --> 00:53:12.965
Oh, my. They're really nice.

00:53:13.295 --> 00:53:14.565
They're so stylish.

00:53:14.865 --> 00:53:16.735
I tried a pair on. They're really comfortable.

00:53:18.635 --> 00:53:20.035
This is Seong Jae's brand.

00:53:20.805 --> 00:53:23.045
I bought them myself without Seong Jae knowing.

00:53:24.545 --> 00:53:25.945
Honey, try them on.

00:53:26.745 --> 00:53:28.645
They're just shoes.

00:53:29.485 --> 00:53:30.745
I'm heading up.

00:53:34.585 --> 00:53:36.155
Just try them on.

00:53:50.735 --> 00:53:51.735
Thanks for breakfast.

00:53:52.335 --> 00:53:53.975
You're unbelievable.

00:53:53.975 --> 00:53:56.005
You could've at least eaten with Mother.

00:53:56.175 --> 00:53:58.945
My stomach feels a little upset. I'm heading out.

You're at the office, right?

00:54:54.735 --> 00:54:56.805
Hyeon Su wants to see you now.

00:55:00.935 --> 00:55:03.745
- I'm taking up your time, aren't I? - No, it's fine.

00:55:03.905 --> 00:55:06.115
- There he is. - He's here.

00:55:06.475 --> 00:55:07.475
Eun Oh.

00:55:07.775 --> 00:55:08.915
I need you here for this too.

00:55:22.365 --> 00:55:25.095
I was surprised. It's your first urgent call to me.

00:55:26.095 --> 00:55:27.395
I have something important to tell you.

00:55:28.065 --> 00:55:29.205
To both of you.

00:55:33.505 --> 00:55:37.105
Ji Hyuk. Renovate this cafe for your business.

00:55:38.145 --> 00:55:39.145
Excuse me?

00:55:39.375 --> 00:55:42.745
I can't say it's rent-free. Just pay 20 percent of the market rate.

00:55:44.085 --> 00:55:45.085
Hyeon Su.

00:55:45.145 --> 00:55:49.755
As you know, I was born rich. My father left me this building.

00:55:50.725 --> 00:55:54.025
And it's not just this building. Plus, I'm not married.

00:55:54.095 --> 00:55:55.595
I don't have any kids to leave it all to.

00:55:56.195 --> 00:55:59.695
And why am I also such a successful architect?

00:56:00.365 --> 00:56:03.705
You know? I'm busy trying to spend all my money.

00:56:04.305 --> 00:56:07.175
Honestly. Some people just have all the luck.

00:56:08.575 --> 00:56:11.275
Hyeon Su, we just renovated this place two years ago.

00:56:11.345 --> 00:56:13.145
That's not the point.

00:56:13.515 --> 00:56:16.445
This place is only meaningful as long as...

00:56:16.515 --> 00:56:18.785
it remains a hub for our alumni community.

00:56:19.615 --> 00:56:23.085
Without that, it's just another boring coffee shop.

00:56:24.085 --> 00:56:25.755
I have no interest in making more money,

00:56:26.125 --> 00:56:29.065
and renting it out is a pain. So instead,

00:56:29.525 --> 00:56:32.565
I'd have more fun watching you two succeed.

00:56:33.495 --> 00:56:36.865
And Eun Oh, you need an office too. Whether you keep working with him,

00:56:36.965 --> 00:56:39.275
or end it and go back to working as Eunoism,

00:56:39.935 --> 00:56:42.275
you can set up your own office space in a corner here.

00:56:43.075 --> 00:56:45.205
- But I... - No, this is exactly it.

00:56:45.545 --> 00:56:46.645
I've got a good feeling about this.

Sponsoring a space for you to grow your businesses.

00:56:50.485 --> 00:56:52.355
And I get to peek in every now and then,

00:56:53.815 --> 00:56:56.585
and think, "Hyeon Su, you really are so generous and brilliant."

00:56:57.225 --> 00:56:58.525
And I'll get a kick out of feeling so smug.

00:57:03.195 --> 00:57:04.795
I really appreciate the gesture,

00:57:05.065 --> 00:57:08.695
but it's all so sudden. I need some time to think about it.

00:57:08.865 --> 00:57:09.865
Hey.

00:57:12.035 --> 00:57:13.175
Hey, Lee Ji Hyuk.

00:57:13.675 --> 00:57:17.475
You've been the only one to stand up to me for the last ten years.

00:57:18.045 --> 00:57:19.245
Don't start acting all grown-up on me now.

00:57:21.445 --> 00:57:22.585
Think about it, though.

00:57:24.645 --> 00:57:26.655
I'm not going to force you.

00:57:40.435 --> 00:57:41.435

After that, I'll be studying in the study hall.

00:58:05.025 --> 00:58:06.055

You know how to do this? Did your kids set it up for you?

No, I did this myself.

Because it's your birthday today.

No, he has a company dinner tonight.

01:00:41.675 --> 01:00:42.685
All right.

01:00:52.225 --> 01:00:54.495
(Convenience Store)

01:01:10.645 --> 01:01:13.315
This girl really knows how to worry me sick.

01:01:21.415 --> 01:01:22.955
- Here you go. - Thanks.

01:01:24.425 --> 01:01:26.355
Someone's texting at this hour.

01:01:26.925 --> 01:01:28.025
I know, right?

01:01:28.895 --> 01:01:30.565
(Spam: Latest stock picks update! Call us now!)

01:01:32.535 --> 01:01:34.595
"Still haven't heard about the stock benefiting most..."

01:01:34.595 --> 01:01:35.865
"from the new policy?"

01:01:37.165 --> 01:01:39.835
Looks like a stock-picking chat room wants to give me tips.

01:01:40.205 --> 01:01:41.205
Goodness.

01:01:42.405 --> 01:01:45.245
Spam texts really come at all hours these days.

01:01:47.245 --> 01:01:48.645
Before I take a shower,

01:01:48.945 --> 01:01:50.215
I'm going to go look at the moon for a bit.

01:01:50.915 --> 01:01:52.985
You still love looking at the moon that much?

01:01:53.485 --> 01:01:56.355
You should be glad I like looking at it by myself.

01:01:56.525 --> 01:01:58.785
Otherwise, I'd be dragging you out with me all the time,

01:01:58.885 --> 01:02:01.695
making you crane your neck to look at the night sky.

01:02:13.075 --> 01:02:16.975
Happy birthday to you

01:02:17.045 --> 01:02:20.645
Happy birthday to you

01:02:20.715 --> 01:02:24.215
Happy birthday to you

01:02:43.735 --> 01:02:44.735
Really?

01:02:45.065 --> 01:02:48.535
Yes. It's a match for the liver transplant.

01:02:49.575 --> 01:02:51.045
It's a match?

01:02:54.045 --> 01:02:55.245
I knew it.

01:03:37.485 --> 01:03:39.755
(Our Golden Days)

01:03:40.055 --> 01:03:42.625
What have you been doing to come home humming to yourself?

01:03:42.695 --> 01:03:46.295
The only reason is another woman. Are you cheating on me?

01:03:46.365 --> 01:03:50.205
Get out! How dare you sneak in without asking,

01:03:50.205 --> 01:03:52.505
acting like the man of the house! Get out now!

01:03:52.635 --> 01:03:55.705
She'll agree to it. My life depends on this.

01:03:56.405 --> 01:03:59.245
I lied to Mom. At this rate...

01:03:59.375 --> 01:04:02.485
- But Gang Oh came all this way... - Did you really abandon me?

01:04:02.545 --> 01:04:05.415
I was leaving, but couldn't look away.

01:04:05.415 --> 01:04:06.755
I'm Ms. Ji's boyfriend.

01:04:06.815 --> 01:04:11.355
If you interfere in my life again, I swear I won't hold back.
