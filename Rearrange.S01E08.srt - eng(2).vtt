00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.080
(Previously)
I know.

00:00:01.105 --> 00:00:02.453
That you like Lin.

00:00:02.746 --> 00:00:05.007
You already knew that Lin and Nut are dating?

00:00:05.814 --> 00:00:07.254
Biu, calm down.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.722
Win.

00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:09.664
I'm great.

00:00:10.222 --> 00:00:11.747
But I'm going to take a rest first.

00:00:12.635 --> 00:00:14.483
Actually, you like Nut too, right?

00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:16.876
Whether I like him or not,

00:00:17.664 --> 00:00:18.904
it doesn't matter, Lin.

00:00:19.022 --> 00:00:20.430
If this is the case,

00:00:20.925 --> 00:00:21.991
I don't think it's convenient for you

00:00:22.015 --> 00:00:23.906
to use the rehearsal room here anymore.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.889
Hey.

00:00:27.153 --> 00:00:28.234
Don't think I'm allowing you

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:29.842
to do that stupid band thing.

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:33.711
Stop it already, with that stupid music practice.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.723
In this condition,

00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:39.014
save your energy for studying.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.911

"Rearrange"
(Episode 8)

00:04:11.057 --> 00:04:12.905
This should be okay...

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.501
It's still not right.

00:04:17.354 --> 00:04:19.544
Oh, is practice over already, son?

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:22.981
We didn't practice, Dad.

00:04:23.108 --> 00:04:24.048
Why not?

00:04:28.536 --> 00:04:29.596
It's a long story.

00:04:33.536 --> 00:04:35.150
Um...

00:04:35.522 --> 00:04:36.555
How about this?

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:39.256
Let's play a game to relieve stress.

00:04:42.217 --> 00:04:43.440
It'll help you relax.

00:04:44.472 --> 00:04:45.559
What genre should we play?

00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:48.335
You can choose for me.

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:51.074
How about something action?

00:04:51.685 --> 00:04:52.680
What kind?

00:04:53.756 --> 00:04:56.506
The game you like to play with Tim is fine.

00:04:56.826 --> 00:04:58.866
Okay, okay. Then let's play...

00:04:59.672 --> 00:05:03.387
Let's play...

00:05:03.412 --> 00:05:05.588
this game then.

00:05:05.614 --> 00:05:06.545
You're not bored of it, right?

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:08.083
Let's try it.

00:05:11.046 --> 00:05:12.801
Okay. Don't forget this.

00:05:12.825 --> 00:05:13.854
You have to follow me.

00:05:13.878 --> 00:05:14.899
So the screen will scroll.

00:05:15.016 --> 00:05:16.100
Otherwise, the screen won't scroll,

00:05:16.124 --> 00:05:17.683
and we'll be stuck.

00:05:19.837 --> 00:05:21.056
We're on the same team.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.656
Father and son helping each other.

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:24.617
It's fun.

00:05:24.641 --> 00:05:25.551
Ready?

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:26.552
Starting now.

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:28.388
Go, go, go! Shoot, shoot, shoot!

00:05:28.421 --> 00:05:30.527
Okay, follow me.

00:05:30.714 --> 00:05:32.215
I'll... there, shoot!

00:05:32.239 --> 00:05:34.215
Collect the items, okay.

00:05:34.681 --> 00:05:36.395
Oh, why did you take 2?

00:05:36.481 --> 00:05:37.689
You didn't share at all.

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:39.904
Let's go, let's go.

00:05:40.753 --> 00:05:42.114
Keep shooting.

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:43.526
Don't stop shooting.

00:05:43.711 --> 00:05:44.883
There are bullets coming.

00:05:45.456 --> 00:05:46.371
Okay, go.

00:05:46.396 --> 00:05:48.012
Okay, let's go, let's go.

00:05:48.097 --> 00:05:49.026
Jump over the bridge.

00:05:49.744 --> 00:05:50.732
Go.

00:05:50.757 --> 00:05:52.207
I told you to follow me.

00:05:52.231 --> 00:05:53.710
The screen isn't scrolling.

00:05:55.305 --> 00:05:56.205
Why...

00:05:58.788 --> 00:05:59.888
What's wrong?

00:06:05.884 --> 00:06:07.721
What did you encounter, son?

00:06:09.204 --> 00:06:10.791
What happened? Tell me.

00:06:14.897 --> 00:06:16.214
It's nothing, Dad.

00:06:16.907 --> 00:06:17.961
Really.

00:06:20.801 --> 00:06:23.456
I'm just happy that you're still here with me.

00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:47.148
To solve this problem,

00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:49.479
we must eliminate a variable

00:06:49.503 --> 00:06:51.211
to leave only one variable.

00:07:02.476 --> 00:07:03.423
Biu.

00:07:06.133 --> 00:07:08.306
Biu, I'm sorry.

00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:14.091
I'm really sorry, Biu.

00:07:14.808 --> 00:07:16.181
Can you please talk to me?

00:07:22.019 --> 00:07:23.528
If you don't talk to me,

00:07:23.954 --> 00:07:25.441
I'm stealing your eraser.

00:07:32.234 --> 00:07:33.277
Teacher.

00:07:33.587 --> 00:07:34.715
Daranphop is talking to me

00:07:34.739 --> 00:07:36.167
and stole my eraser.

00:07:37.047 --> 00:07:39.601
Daranphop, go stand outside.

00:07:42.683 --> 00:07:43.689
Yes.

00:07:57.506 --> 00:07:58.673
Biu.

00:07:58.745 --> 00:08:00.212
Stay away from me.

00:08:00.772 --> 00:08:02.092
Can you talk to me first?

00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:04.627
I don't want to talk to you, Win.

00:08:05.347 --> 00:08:06.863
I'm sorry, Biu.

00:08:06.888 --> 00:08:08.168
You don't have to apologize.

00:08:08.966 --> 00:08:10.826
You let me go and make a fool of myself

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.797
even though you already knew everything.

00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:15.361
What kind of friend does that?

00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:17.981
You once said that in the future,

00:08:18.507 --> 00:08:20.007
you and I would be friends.

00:08:21.422 --> 00:08:23.470
I think you can change the future now.

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.667
I don't want to be your friend anymore.

00:08:26.095 --> 00:08:27.243
From this day on,

00:08:27.267 --> 00:08:28.801
I'm not talking to you anymore.

00:08:29.732 --> 00:08:30.721
For the rest of my life.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:43.493
Biu.

00:08:48.281 --> 00:08:49.441
What's up, Lin?

00:08:58.476 --> 00:08:59.924
I'm sorry.

00:09:01.597 --> 00:09:04.292
What are you sorry for?

00:09:07.301 --> 00:09:08.410
Well...

00:09:09.488 --> 00:09:10.908
Actually,

00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:14.388
Lin and Nut are not dating.

00:09:17.109 --> 00:09:18.102
Nut.

00:09:19.384 --> 00:09:20.778
I have something to tell you.

00:09:21.037 --> 00:09:21.977
What is it?

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.860
I think...

00:09:27.388 --> 00:09:28.659
I like you, Nut.

00:09:35.404 --> 00:09:36.758
I'm sorry, Lin.

00:09:38.664 --> 00:09:40.604
I already like someone else.

00:09:51.666 --> 00:09:53.649
I was shocked at that time.

00:09:54.732 --> 00:09:56.608
I didn't know how to respond.

00:09:57.497 --> 00:09:59.635
So I just lied like that.

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:04.413
I didn't want Win and you to misunderstand each other.

00:10:07.116 --> 00:10:08.825
I'm really sorry.

00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:13.778
So, Lin and Nut

00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:16.012
are not dating?

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:20.846
Yes.

00:10:22.998 --> 00:10:24.618
Shit.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.807
What's wrong with you?

00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:46.222
I thought you said you'd stop being my friend for life.

00:10:46.522 --> 00:10:47.595
Well...

00:10:47.722 --> 00:10:49.390
I misunderstood you.

00:10:49.754 --> 00:10:51.229
I'm sorry.

00:10:53.587 --> 00:10:54.802
What are you sorry for?

00:10:55.475 --> 00:10:58.205
For thinking that you already knew

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.736
that Lin and Nut were dating and didn't tell me.

00:11:00.761 --> 00:11:02.893
And for letting me do something stupid.

00:11:04.666 --> 00:11:06.379
So Lin and Nut aren't dating?

00:11:06.574 --> 00:11:08.607
Yup, Lin and Nut are not dating.

00:11:08.854 --> 00:11:10.068
Huh?

I'll practice in my room.

00:11:38.512 --> 00:11:40.081
What more do you want, Dad?

00:11:40.105 --> 00:11:41.766
Don't you understand?

00:11:42.007 --> 00:11:43.689
This music thing

00:11:43.713 --> 00:11:46.197
is not going to help your future.

00:11:47.232 --> 00:11:49.127
I don't have a future anyway, Dad.

00:11:49.787 --> 00:11:50.934
What do you mean?

00:11:51.454 --> 00:11:53.694
Please just let me do what I want to do.

00:11:55.418 --> 00:11:56.492
Because soon,

00:11:56.872 --> 00:11:58.005
I'll be dead anyway.

00:12:00.243 --> 00:12:01.448
What are you talking about?

00:12:02.208 --> 00:12:03.456
Are you threatening me?

00:12:12.931 --> 00:12:14.304
You don't have to care, Dad.

00:12:16.975 --> 00:12:18.210
Because in the past,

00:12:19.116 --> 00:12:20.718
you've never cared about me anyway.

00:12:32.743 --> 00:12:34.042
So...

00:12:34.468 --> 00:12:35.815
you already knew

00:12:35.839 --> 00:12:37.513
and let me go and make a fool of myself,

00:12:37.795 --> 00:12:40.468
or did you not know either?

00:12:44.385 --> 00:12:45.380
Well...

00:12:46.448 --> 00:12:48.138
I just misunderstood,

00:12:48.162 --> 00:12:50.069
I thought Nut and Lin were already dating.

00:12:50.287 --> 00:12:51.657
And I couldn't stop you in time.

00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:52.690
Hey.

00:12:52.714 --> 00:12:53.710
So that means

00:12:53.734 --> 00:12:55.581
I should go back to being mad at you, right?

00:12:56.423 --> 00:12:57.698
It's too late for that.

00:12:59.045 --> 00:13:00.741
Damn, I should have stayed mad

00:13:00.765 --> 00:13:02.814
and let you treat me to meals for 3 months.

00:13:05.336 --> 00:13:07.264
And why would I have to treat you to meals?

00:13:07.737 --> 00:13:09.881
Didn't you break up with me?

00:13:09.905 --> 00:13:13.911
You told me you were breaking up with me for life.

00:13:15.375 --> 00:13:16.971
Why do you keep repeating that?

00:13:17.002 --> 00:13:18.527
Yeah, my life is short.

00:13:18.551 --> 00:13:19.918
Are you satisfied now?

00:13:21.469 --> 00:13:23.735
Seriously though...

00:13:23.881 --> 00:13:25.876
are you really from the future?

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.525
You don't know anything.

00:13:29.036 --> 00:13:30.709
It wasn't like this back then.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.513
Then...

00:13:34.538 --> 00:13:36.861
that means the future you came from

00:13:36.885 --> 00:13:38.166
can be changed.

00:13:44.216 --> 00:13:45.577
I'm not sure about that.

00:13:46.324 --> 00:13:48.579
I mean, I've tried.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.875
Even if the method changes,

00:13:50.899 --> 00:13:52.315
the result is still the same.

00:13:53.075 --> 00:13:54.923
So that means

00:13:54.947 --> 00:13:56.831
in the future you came from,

00:13:56.855 --> 00:13:58.967
Lin and Nut weren't dating.

00:14:07.652 --> 00:14:08.605
And you,

00:14:09.101 --> 00:14:10.225
are you sure

00:14:10.249 --> 00:14:11.783
that Lin and Nut are not dating now?

00:14:11.863 --> 00:14:12.874
Yup.

00:14:12.899 --> 00:14:15.031
If you don't believe, why don't you call and ask Nut?

00:14:16.918 --> 00:14:18.251
Then what do you want me to do?

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:20.806
Call Nut's house number.

00:14:20.993 --> 00:14:23.243
And when his dad answers, say,

00:14:23.267 --> 00:14:24.549
"Hello, Mr. Nut's dad.

00:14:24.573 --> 00:14:26.196
This is Win. May I speak to Nut?"

00:14:26.569 --> 00:14:29.035
And when he comes on, I should just ask him,

00:14:29.162 --> 00:14:31.184
"Are you and Lin dating right now?"

00:14:31.209 --> 00:14:32.298
Like that?

00:14:32.834 --> 00:14:34.582
Yes, do it now.

00:14:35.084 --> 00:14:36.544
That's very weird.

00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:39.591
Mmm...

00:14:39.615 --> 00:14:41.474
If you don't dare, then I'll call.

00:14:41.499 --> 00:14:42.744
I remember his house number.

00:14:42.782 --> 00:14:43.890
No way, Biu.

00:14:43.914 --> 00:14:45.263
Sit down. No.

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:46.693
- No, no.
- Why not?

00:14:46.718 --> 00:14:48.505
If you don't dare, I'll call myself, just a second.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.133
It's weird. No.

00:14:50.706 --> 00:14:52.826
Oh, someone's calling.

00:14:54.295 --> 00:14:56.003
Then I'll get it.

00:15:06.786 --> 00:15:07.846
Hello.

00:15:08.326 --> 00:15:09.968
Why do you sound so tired?

00:15:11.927 --> 00:15:12.973
Is that Nut?

00:15:13.866 --> 00:15:15.022
Yeah, it's me.

00:15:17.155 --> 00:15:18.686
Why are you calling so late? Is something wrong?

00:15:19.785 --> 00:15:21.693
Well, I have something on my mind.

00:15:22.319 --> 00:15:23.761
What's on your mind?

00:15:26.245 --> 00:15:27.645
My dad.

00:15:28.585 --> 00:15:30.276
The misunderstanding you have about me.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:32.337
The band.

00:15:33.418 --> 00:15:34.933
It's a lot of things combined.

00:15:36.508 --> 00:15:37.468
I think...

00:15:38.283 --> 00:15:40.036
I didn't misunderstand anything about you, Nut.

00:15:41.402 --> 00:15:43.388
And about you not dating Lin,

00:15:44.368 --> 00:15:45.402
I already know.

00:15:48.525 --> 00:15:50.336
Then I'm relieved about one thing.

00:15:52.488 --> 00:15:53.648
And what about the band?

00:15:54.656 --> 00:15:56.365
Lin told me that

00:15:57.097 --> 00:15:59.165
Ek's parents won't let us
practice at their house anymore.

00:16:00.043 --> 00:16:01.165
Mmm-hmm.

00:16:01.623 --> 00:16:02.689
Yes.

00:16:02.969 --> 00:16:04.730
So now we're practicing separately.

00:16:06.082 --> 00:16:07.468
So will it be okay?

00:16:07.881 --> 00:16:09.563
The competition is in a few days.

00:16:12.102 --> 00:16:13.349
We have to make it.

00:16:14.022 --> 00:16:16.994
About the band, I'll try to figure something out.

00:16:17.847 --> 00:16:19.082
So,

00:16:19.106 --> 00:16:21.735
you've got 2 things off your mind now.

00:16:23.612 --> 00:16:26.572
The rest is probably about your dad.

00:16:29.762 --> 00:16:31.630
About my dad, I don't know what to do.

00:16:32.666 --> 00:16:34.371
He's like he's possessed again.

00:16:34.395 --> 00:16:35.936
He won't let me go to practice.

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:41.756
About this, I can only give you my support.

00:16:44.697 --> 00:16:45.923
Yeah.

00:16:47.355 --> 00:16:48.956
That's all I need.

00:16:57.708 --> 00:16:58.595
Win.

00:16:59.124 --> 00:17:00.131
What is it?

00:17:05.475 --> 00:17:06.655
After the competition,

00:17:07.748 --> 00:17:09.008
I have something I want to tell you.

00:17:22.446 --> 00:17:23.480
Win.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.616
Are you still listening?

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.783
Can't you just tell me now?

00:17:35.115 --> 00:17:36.751
The competition is in a few days.

00:17:37.652 --> 00:17:39.396
Can't you wait a little longer?

00:17:45.005 --> 00:17:46.239
Hey, Win.

00:17:47.434 --> 00:17:48.873
My dad is coming down.

00:17:49.779 --> 00:17:50.995
I have to hang up now.

00:17:51.774 --> 00:17:52.948
Good night.

00:18:05.425 --> 00:18:06.666
Good night.

00:18:16.041 --> 00:18:17.281
"Good night."

00:18:45.609 --> 00:18:46.968
Happy birthday, Mom.

00:18:47.816 --> 00:18:50.010
Oh, is it my birthday today?

00:18:53.192 --> 00:18:54.379
Yeah.

00:18:54.866 --> 00:18:56.080
Thanks.

00:18:59.408 --> 00:19:01.115
What is this?

00:19:12.662 --> 00:19:13.753
Don't tell me.

00:19:13.777 --> 00:19:16.637
Is this why you went back to play at the bar?

00:19:21.686 --> 00:19:23.451
You didn't have to buy it.

00:19:23.475 --> 00:19:24.976
It's a waste of money.

00:19:33.363 --> 00:19:34.910
Consider it me returning it to you, Mom.

00:19:35.295 --> 00:19:36.559
For...

00:19:37.479 --> 00:19:39.259
you having to sell it because of me before.

00:19:41.209 --> 00:19:42.822
Oh, thanks.

00:19:51.871 --> 00:19:54.612
Don't get into any more trouble, understand?

00:19:55.521 --> 00:19:57.321
I don't want to see you get hurt.

00:20:15.423 --> 00:20:17.663
Here. Take this.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.564
Here.

00:20:23.956 --> 00:20:25.908
It's my birthday, after all.

00:20:27.006 --> 00:20:28.432
Have a drink with your mom.

00:22:03.876 --> 00:22:05.696
Dad, Mom.

00:22:06.266 --> 00:22:07.551
I have something to talk to you about.

00:22:17.217 --> 00:22:18.207
Hey.

00:22:18.425 --> 00:22:19.540
By the way...

00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:22.517
How did you get your parents
to let us practice here again?

00:22:22.837 --> 00:22:25.041
It was nothing, just asked nicely.

00:22:26.094 --> 00:22:27.354
That's it?

00:22:28.229 --> 00:22:29.888
What should we do, guys?

00:22:29.912 --> 00:22:31.899
The competition is the day after tomorrow.

00:22:32.241 --> 00:22:34.327
We have a big rehearsal tomorrow.

00:22:34.614 --> 00:22:36.953
And you're going to let Nut go up on the actual day

00:22:36.977 --> 00:22:38.647
when we've been practicing separately?

00:22:39.302 --> 00:22:40.188
That's right.

00:22:43.467 --> 00:22:44.633
I have a way.

00:22:45.535 --> 00:22:46.582
What way?

00:22:48.239 --> 00:22:49.240
Ek.

00:22:50.772 --> 00:22:53.002
We can practice late tomorrow, right?

00:22:54.235 --> 00:22:55.530
No problem.

00:22:55.978 --> 00:22:57.812
Then don't worry.

00:22:58.017 --> 00:22:59.531
Let's just practice this much for today.

00:23:00.757 --> 00:23:01.831
Okay, okay.

00:23:01.856 --> 00:23:02.713
Okay.

Aren't you worried at all?

00:24:13.599 --> 00:24:16.256
Or do you know something from the future again?

00:24:17.113 --> 00:24:18.780
I don't really know anything.

00:24:19.025 --> 00:24:21.550
But like I told you, I have a way.

00:24:21.816 --> 00:24:22.922
Because of that,

00:24:22.946 --> 00:24:24.847
I couldn't sleep since last night.

00:24:25.299 --> 00:24:26.747
What way is that?

00:24:27.945 --> 00:24:28.960
Do you know,

00:24:28.985 --> 00:24:31.279
besides being able to sing and play music,

00:24:31.303 --> 00:24:32.317
what else I'm good at?

00:24:32.486 --> 00:24:34.606
What, cooking?

00:24:36.848 --> 00:24:37.769
It's like this.

00:24:38.372 --> 00:24:40.326
Back when I was in university,

00:24:40.812 --> 00:24:42.272
in my past life,

00:24:42.599 --> 00:24:43.911
I lived in the dorms, right?

00:24:43.935 --> 00:24:46.416
And the dorms had a lot of rules.

00:24:46.946 --> 00:24:48.416
Especially if you came back late,

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.708
you'd get points deducted.

00:24:50.956 --> 00:24:53.322
So what does that have to do with anything?

00:24:55.391 --> 00:24:58.352
It made me discover another one of my talents.

00:25:08.403 --> 00:25:09.656
Being a thief?

00:25:10.436 --> 00:25:11.971
I mean climbing into the dorm.

00:25:12.231 --> 00:25:14.533
And how is that different from being a thief?

00:25:14.913 --> 00:25:16.066
Come on.

00:25:16.485 --> 00:25:17.934
You be the lookout.

00:25:17.996 --> 00:25:19.116
Yeah, yeah.

00:25:46.362 --> 00:25:47.348
Nut.

00:25:51.745 --> 00:25:52.958
How did you get here?

00:25:53.285 --> 00:25:54.557
Don't ask questions.

00:25:54.581 --> 00:25:56.048
Let's just go practice. Let's go.

00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:10.028
Be careful.

00:26:13.301 --> 00:26:14.274
Quick!

00:26:15.658 --> 00:26:16.964
Go, go, go.

00:26:18.035 --> 00:26:19.301
Careful, careful.

00:26:19.862 --> 00:26:21.708
Just put it there.

00:27:26.226 --> 00:27:27.272
Lift it.

00:27:28.031 --> 00:27:29.038
Be careful.

00:27:32.395 --> 00:27:33.482
Gently.

00:27:34.875 --> 00:27:35.914
A little more.

00:27:47.139 --> 00:27:48.228
I'm going now.

00:28:14.911 --> 00:28:16.211
Wait a second.

00:28:17.263 --> 00:28:18.203
Hey.

00:28:18.228 --> 00:28:19.333
Shit.

00:28:30.286 --> 00:28:31.675
Why did you come up?

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:33.330
Nut.

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:34.838
The thing you were going to tell me tomorrow,

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:36.477
can you just tell me now?

00:28:37.889 --> 00:28:39.500
Can't you wait just one more night?

00:28:48.978 --> 00:28:50.987
Shit.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.047
Go now.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:07.257
No one is helping me.

00:30:00.365 --> 00:30:01.428
What now?

00:30:02.705 --> 00:30:03.892
Want to sleep in my room?

00:30:10.118 --> 00:30:11.512
I probably can't sleep here.

00:30:12.326 --> 00:30:14.312
Your dad will catch me in the morning.

00:30:15.614 --> 00:30:17.882
I'll sneak out later tonight.

00:30:30.587 --> 00:30:31.474
Win.

00:30:35.352 --> 00:30:36.901
Thank you so much.

00:30:38.137 --> 00:30:39.992
For climbing and taking me to practice.

00:30:43.735 --> 00:30:45.079
You don't have to thank me.

00:30:46.449 --> 00:30:47.610
It's just a small thing.

00:30:50.506 --> 00:30:53.377
And what about your illness?

00:30:54.225 --> 00:30:55.212
How is it?

00:30:56.415 --> 00:30:57.831
Do you see anything wrong with me?

00:30:58.381 --> 00:31:01.050
I was just running with you.

00:31:01.804 --> 00:31:03.211
This is nothing.

00:31:05.142 --> 00:31:06.488
I don't believe you.

00:31:08.634 --> 00:31:09.874
Trust me.

00:31:13.112 --> 00:31:15.007
Even if I really got sick,

00:31:15.031 --> 00:31:16.267
what could you do?

00:31:18.871 --> 00:31:20.839
Would you force me not to compete tomorrow?

00:31:28.446 --> 00:31:29.459
I guess...

00:31:30.506 --> 00:31:32.070
I can't force you, right?

00:31:32.838 --> 00:31:33.965
Exactly.

00:31:35.355 --> 00:31:37.552
And you don't have to overthink it either.

00:31:38.292 --> 00:31:39.699
Or you won't be able to concentrate tomorrow.

00:31:44.051 --> 00:31:46.130
If you really don't want me to lose focus,

00:31:49.212 --> 00:31:50.752
the thing you want to tell me,

00:31:52.916 --> 00:31:54.089
can you tell me now?

00:31:59.989 --> 00:32:00.962
No.

00:32:44.413 --> 00:32:45.393
Win.

00:32:49.792 --> 00:32:51.704
I have a song that I wrote a long time ago.

00:32:51.728 --> 00:32:52.642
I just finished it.

00:32:54.139 --> 00:32:55.625

Are you worried about me?

00:34:22.526 --> 00:34:23.786
Do you think...

00:34:25.934 --> 00:34:27.554
we should start a band together?

Where are you going?

00:36:16.778 --> 00:36:18.456
Didn't you listen to what I said?

00:36:22.158 --> 00:36:23.589
I already told you, Dad.

00:36:23.735 --> 00:36:25.216
This is the path I choose.

00:36:26.173 --> 00:36:27.819
A path with no future?

00:36:28.229 --> 00:36:30.123
I won't let you choose it, understand?

00:36:32.797 --> 00:36:34.517
But you have no right to force me.

00:36:35.085 --> 00:36:37.593
I'm your father, why wouldn't I have the right?

00:36:47.426 --> 00:36:49.126
This will be the last time, Dad.

00:36:52.722 --> 00:36:54.456
I promise that if I don't win,

00:36:56.169 --> 00:36:58.583
I will quit playing music as you wish.

00:37:01.575 --> 00:37:02.801
If you don't let me go,

00:37:02.825 --> 00:37:04.432
I will never quit.

00:37:07.903 --> 00:37:09.108
If you want me to quit,

00:37:11.901 --> 00:37:13.718
you should let me go and lose.

00:37:23.703 --> 00:37:24.843
Nut!

00:37:48.803 --> 00:37:49.673
Biu.

00:37:49.697 --> 00:37:52.238
Where have you been, in the jungle? Huh?

00:37:54.174 --> 00:37:55.201
None of your business.

00:38:00.404 --> 00:38:02.628
So, where's Nut?

00:38:04.965 --> 00:38:06.315
He'll probably be here soon.

00:38:08.337 --> 00:38:10.270
Then I'll go call Nut.

00:38:10.917 --> 00:38:12.114
Thanks, Lin.

00:38:17.081 --> 00:38:18.634
I'm going to check the stage for a bit.

00:38:52.336 --> 00:38:54.793
Do you think Nut will be able to make it?

00:39:00.232 --> 00:39:01.593
I'm not sure.

00:39:11.241 --> 00:39:13.474
A brain tumor has been detected.

00:39:14.427 --> 00:39:16.038
Looking at the symptoms,

00:39:16.062 --> 00:39:17.909
it seems the symptoms have only recently appeared.

00:39:19.004 --> 00:39:21.576
So how will he be treated?

00:39:22.586 --> 00:39:24.224
It depends on several factors.

00:39:24.746 --> 00:39:26.993
But right now, our hospital

00:39:27.046 --> 00:39:28.478
probably doesn't have enough equipment

00:39:28.502 --> 00:39:30.300
for surgical treatment.

00:39:31.627 --> 00:39:33.745
If he is to be treated,
he will have to be transferred

00:39:33.769 --> 00:39:36.263
to have surgery in Bangkok instead.

00:40:16.141 --> 00:40:17.542
What were you thinking?

00:40:18.645 --> 00:40:19.984
Why didn't you tell me?

00:40:23.155 --> 00:40:26.102
I was going to tell you both
after today's competition.

00:40:26.523 --> 00:40:28.036
That's enough.

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:29.508
Rest, son.

00:40:30.405 --> 00:40:32.033
Stop thinking about the competition.

00:40:32.508 --> 00:40:34.488
I'm asking you, please, son.

00:40:38.238 --> 00:40:39.839
Mom, but I...

00:40:39.863 --> 00:40:41.233
You have to stay here.

00:40:41.891 --> 00:40:43.452
I'll have the doctor prepare your surgery

00:40:43.476 --> 00:40:44.577
as soon as possible.

00:40:47.902 --> 00:40:49.901
Listen to him, son.

00:40:50.955 --> 00:40:52.328
Get some rest.

00:40:52.896 --> 00:40:53.943
Okay?

00:40:54.429 --> 00:40:55.613
Slowly.

00:44:36.352 --> 00:44:38.455
I called his house but no one answered.

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:48.390

(Next Episode)
When you knew Mom wasn't going to make it,

00:45:58.117 --> 00:45:59.265
what did you do?

00:46:03.617 --> 00:46:05.384
In your past life,

00:46:06.003 --> 00:46:07.584
Nut didn't survive, right?

00:46:09.509 --> 00:46:11.311
He probably already left you.

00:46:11.335 --> 00:46:12.837
You just find someone new.

00:46:13.086 --> 00:46:14.381
I already promised.

00:46:14.578 --> 00:46:15.820
That after the surgery,

00:46:15.845 --> 00:46:17.595
I would come back to you first.

00:46:18.587 --> 00:46:20.437
I think I tried my best.

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:22.783
But the result is still the same.
