From this moment on,

00:00:12.934 --> 00:00:14.734
I'm gonna win you over.

00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:50.247
♫No words needed to realize you're the one♫

00:00:50.287 --> 00:01:00.214
♫I was born to be the moon to your sun♫

00:01:00.774 --> 00:01:08.175
♫With you by my side,
there's nothing else I'd like♫

00:01:09.334 --> 00:01:13.854
♫You're the love I'm longing for♫

00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:18.134
♫The heaven-sent one I adore♫

00:01:18.174 --> 00:01:19.014
Doc!

00:01:19.054 --> 00:01:24.934
♫The final answer to my prayers♫

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:32.134
♫My heart will belong to you♫

00:01:44.894 --> 00:01:46.054
I kissed...

00:01:46.534 --> 00:01:47.694
a woman.

00:01:48.054 --> 00:01:50.094
From this moment on,

00:01:50.134 --> 00:01:51.974
I'm gonna win you over.

00:02:08.047 --> 00:02:09.540
Her lips are so soft.

00:02:19.614 --> 00:02:21.774
[Nam]

00:02:42.814 --> 00:02:43.814
[Nam]

00:03:12.414 --> 00:03:14.174
I know you saw me, Doc.

00:03:16.094 --> 00:03:17.854
Can you open the door for me, please?

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:22.614
What are you so afraid

00:03:23.534 --> 00:03:25.054
I'll do to you?

00:03:29.814 --> 00:03:31.694
What more do you need, Miss Pat?

00:03:32.254 --> 00:03:34.654
I just thought
I should introduce myself to my neighbor.

00:03:35.054 --> 00:03:36.054
That's everything, right?

00:03:39.054 --> 00:03:41.054
I wanna say I like it.

00:03:43.214 --> 00:03:44.214
What are you talking about?

00:03:44.534 --> 00:03:45.534
I'm talking about

00:03:46.214 --> 00:03:47.534
what happened in the elevator.

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:56.174
Is the feeling one-sided?

00:03:59.774 --> 00:04:00.854
I doubt it.

00:04:01.214 --> 00:04:02.854
You seemed pretty into it, too.

00:04:03.614 --> 00:04:05.254
You're pretty good at imagining things.

00:04:05.494 --> 00:04:07.214
I'm not imagining things

00:04:08.094 --> 00:04:10.334
since it didn't look like
you wanted to back off.

00:04:11.614 --> 00:04:12.476
I was...

00:04:12.812 --> 00:04:13.734
I...

00:04:13.774 --> 00:04:14.894
I was just stunned

00:04:15.207 --> 00:04:16.407
since it caught me off guard.

00:04:16.974 --> 00:04:17.854
Were you?

00:04:18.694 --> 00:04:19.334
Yes.

00:04:19.974 --> 00:04:21.454
I'm not gonna make a big deal out of this.

00:04:21.633 --> 00:04:24.374
I'll just assume you were so startled

00:04:24.414 --> 00:04:27.014
that you weren't acting like yourself.

00:04:28.374 --> 00:04:29.614
But don't you ever think

00:04:30.534 --> 00:04:32.294
of pulling a fast one on me again!

00:04:37.374 --> 00:04:38.934
She's just here to get on my nerves!

00:04:39.734 --> 00:04:40.894
It's not a bad decision

00:04:41.254 --> 00:04:43.334
to move to the same condo as hers.

00:04:44.014 --> 00:04:45.654
I really want to start fresh.

00:04:46.374 --> 00:04:47.374
What should I do?

00:04:48.494 --> 00:04:49.494
I have an idea!

00:04:50.614 --> 00:04:52.694
Since you're influential

00:04:53.134 --> 00:04:54.334
and know a lot of people,

00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:56.534
can you find out

00:04:56.774 --> 00:04:58.094
where Dr. Prem lives?

00:04:58.414 --> 00:04:59.934
Pat, you crazy girl!

00:05:00.194 --> 00:05:02.014
This is not something you can just do!

00:05:02.334 --> 00:05:03.494
Except that you can.

00:05:03.734 --> 00:05:05.414
You never, ever miss

00:05:05.454 --> 00:05:07.534
where your partner's
little side pieces are.

00:05:08.054 --> 00:05:09.214
This can be done

00:05:09.734 --> 00:05:10.614
with your eyes shut.

00:05:11.334 --> 00:05:12.894
Help me, would you?

00:05:16.054 --> 00:05:17.894
She lives in Canapaya Residences?!

00:05:17.934 --> 00:05:20.054
Yeah, and why would you be so thrilled?

00:05:20.574 --> 00:05:23.174
My brother bought a unit there!

00:05:25.174 --> 00:05:27.214
God is finally on my side.

00:06:17.974 --> 00:06:19.094
Morning, Doc.

00:06:36.094 --> 00:06:37.094
Hey, you!

00:06:37.454 --> 00:06:39.494
Do you get off work at the usual time?

00:06:39.654 --> 00:06:41.214
Maybe we can eat noodles again.

00:06:42.994 --> 00:06:44.614
Give me back my earphone.

00:06:44.974 --> 00:06:47.294
Or should we go see a movie?

00:06:47.614 --> 00:06:49.134
There are tons of new ones in theaters.

00:06:49.654 --> 00:06:51.214
I can even rent out a whole theater,

00:06:51.514 --> 00:06:53.054
so we can be alone.

00:06:53.454 --> 00:06:54.687
I don't want to see it.

00:06:54.727 --> 00:06:56.574
Then, what do you want to do, Doc?

00:06:57.154 --> 00:06:58.574
I want my earphone back.

00:07:00.094 --> 00:07:01.094
I'll give it back.

00:07:02.514 --> 00:07:04.254
But can you just listen to me first?

00:07:04.734 --> 00:07:06.414
Make it quick.

00:07:09.654 --> 00:07:11.934
I know that
you've never been into women before.

00:07:12.254 --> 00:07:13.414
Good for you.

00:07:14.454 --> 00:07:16.254
But being with a woman is really good.

00:07:17.254 --> 00:07:18.814
We're more understanding,

00:07:19.432 --> 00:07:21.144
more considerate,

00:07:21.694 --> 00:07:22.974
and...

00:07:23.554 --> 00:07:24.974
a lot safer.

00:07:26.694 --> 00:07:27.814
Safer?

00:07:28.094 --> 00:07:29.694
You're the danger itself.

00:07:30.174 --> 00:07:34.574
♫You make me melt
every time you lean closer♫

00:07:34.814 --> 00:07:39.574
♫Your gaze makes me lose my mind♫

00:07:39.614 --> 00:07:44.174
♫You're the only one I want by my side♫

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:45.214
Don't follow me.

00:07:47.534 --> 00:07:48.454
Fine,

00:07:49.054 --> 00:07:50.054
I won't

00:07:50.621 --> 00:07:52.591
since we will definitely
see each other again.

00:07:53.454 --> 00:07:55.774
♫Come taste me, and you will see♫

00:07:55.814 --> 00:07:58.174
♫How much I want you, baby♫

00:07:58.214 --> 00:08:02.814
♫What will it take for you to cave in?♫

00:08:12.254 --> 00:08:13.654
Pat!

00:08:15.214 --> 00:08:18.294
Thank you so much
for helping me with the live stream.

00:08:18.334 --> 00:08:20.494
The shoe sales are insane!

00:08:20.794 --> 00:08:22.134
I'm so happy for you.

00:08:22.414 --> 00:08:24.494
Your shoes are of good quality;

00:08:24.534 --> 00:08:25.974
it's not just because of me.

00:08:26.654 --> 00:08:28.494
Well, you're right about that!

00:08:30.234 --> 00:08:32.334
But if there's any more work
for me in the future,

00:08:32.374 --> 00:08:34.134
you can contact me directly.

00:08:34.474 --> 00:08:36.414
Wait, what about Nam?

00:08:36.614 --> 00:08:38.814
Isn't she your manager anymore?

00:08:57.494 --> 00:08:58.494
Thank you.

00:09:02.014 --> 00:09:04.174
Pick whatever you wanna eat, Pat.

00:09:07.414 --> 00:09:08.894
What do you feel like today?

00:09:09.134 --> 00:09:11.654
Maybe... some noodles?

00:09:11.694 --> 00:09:13.174
That's your favorite dish,

00:09:13.614 --> 00:09:15.334
and this restaurant
makes delicious noodles.

00:09:17.334 --> 00:09:18.694
Just order it.

00:09:18.894 --> 00:09:19.494
Mm,

00:09:19.534 --> 00:09:22.374
I'll go ahead and order the noodles.

00:09:22.414 --> 00:09:24.334
If you're feeling something more,

00:09:24.374 --> 00:09:26.014
just go ahead and tell me.

00:09:28.454 --> 00:09:30.334
One noodle soup,

00:09:30.374 --> 00:09:32.934
one spaghetti carbonara,

00:09:32.974 --> 00:09:34.054
and two cups of green tea,

00:09:34.254 --> 00:09:35.174
please.

00:09:35.854 --> 00:09:37.054
Here.

00:10:25.774 --> 00:10:27.014
Don't you even think

00:10:27.214 --> 00:10:29.054
I'm gonna make a wife out of you.

00:10:30.454 --> 00:10:31.694
Your kind of woman

00:10:32.054 --> 00:10:34.054
doesn't deserve someone like me.

00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:40.472
- Alright.
- Alright.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.327
Be right back.

00:10:52.574 --> 00:10:55.494
I'll use the restroom, then.

00:11:09.294 --> 00:11:10.054
Hello?

00:11:10.094 --> 00:11:12.294
Sweet Prem, it's me.

00:11:12.334 --> 00:11:13.774
I want to talk.

00:11:13.814 --> 00:11:14.954
Can we please just meet?

00:11:19.774 --> 00:11:20.442
Thawat,

00:11:20.694 --> 00:11:22.214
I don't have anything more to say.

00:11:22.414 --> 00:11:24.014
Please stop calling!

00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.478
Hi, Miss Prem.

00:11:33.014 --> 00:11:34.254
You...

00:11:35.054 --> 00:11:36.254
You know me?

00:11:36.734 --> 00:11:37.454
Of course.

00:11:37.774 --> 00:11:39.814
I'm the mother of Thawat's baby.

00:11:49.654 --> 00:11:50.654
Excuse me?

00:12:00.614 --> 00:12:02.014
What do you want from me?

00:12:05.174 --> 00:12:06.854
I just wanna see you up close.

00:12:07.414 --> 00:12:08.534
You have a pretty face

00:12:08.734 --> 00:12:10.334
and a respectable job;

00:12:10.534 --> 00:12:12.574
why are you still
holding onto someone else's man?

00:12:13.334 --> 00:12:15.414
Look at the nerve you have
to claim him as your man,

00:12:15.574 --> 00:12:17.014
even though you stole him.

00:12:17.054 --> 00:12:18.134
I didn't.

00:12:18.294 --> 00:12:19.934
You're the one stealing Thawat from me!

00:12:20.374 --> 00:12:21.214
If it wasn't for you,

00:12:21.254 --> 00:12:22.894
he wouldn't have left me!

00:12:23.574 --> 00:12:24.574
Oh,

00:12:25.514 --> 00:12:27.014
so he dumped you.

00:12:27.894 --> 00:12:28.974
That figures.

00:12:29.734 --> 00:12:31.094
Why don't you look in the mirror

00:12:31.694 --> 00:12:33.214
before pointing fingers at someone?

00:12:33.814 --> 00:12:36.734
You have no shame in being a home-wrecker,

00:12:37.774 --> 00:12:39.454
and now you're even turning into a bully?

00:12:41.654 --> 00:12:42.654
Please just stop.

00:12:43.414 --> 00:12:44.974
At least for the sake of your baby.

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:46.974
Hey, you!

00:12:49.766 --> 00:12:50.804
Nam, stop that right now!

00:12:59.254 --> 00:12:59.934
Pat,

00:12:59.959 --> 00:13:02.079
this woman was being rude to me.

00:13:02.134 --> 00:13:03.694
She accused me of being a home-wrecker

00:13:03.734 --> 00:13:05.174
and even insulted me!

00:13:05.494 --> 00:13:07.894
My friend is never
the type to start a fight!

00:13:09.774 --> 00:13:11.014
If you want a problem,

00:13:11.454 --> 00:13:12.654
I can give you one right now.

00:13:12.694 --> 00:13:13.694
Bow, don't.

00:13:17.614 --> 00:13:19.294
Keep a close eye on your friend.

00:13:19.934 --> 00:13:21.454
Don't let her bother me ever again.

00:13:36.214 --> 00:13:37.134
Nam,

00:13:37.174 --> 00:13:38.894
why would you mess with her like that?!

00:13:39.394 --> 00:13:40.487
It's all because of her!

00:13:40.527 --> 00:13:43.134
That witch is the reason
I ended up like this!

00:13:43.374 --> 00:13:44.614
Wake up, Nam!

00:13:44.814 --> 00:13:46.698
You're the one to blame here,

00:13:47.054 --> 00:13:48.047
not Dr. Prem!

00:13:48.253 --> 00:13:49.894
Why aren't you on my side?

00:13:49.942 --> 00:13:52.502
I won't side with the wrong anymore.

00:13:52.534 --> 00:13:53.495
But she said

00:13:53.519 --> 00:13:55.014
she already forgave Thawat.

00:13:57.014 --> 00:13:57.897
How did you know that?

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.522
Well, those are her words.

00:14:01.134 --> 00:14:02.014
You weren't here before;

00:14:02.039 --> 00:14:04.039
you didn't hear half
of what she said to me!

00:14:05.734 --> 00:14:06.974
Let's call it a day right here.

00:14:07.374 --> 00:14:08.374
I wanna go home.

00:14:09.134 --> 00:14:09.914
Pat!

00:14:10.774 --> 00:14:12.494
So I will see you tomorrow?

00:14:12.634 --> 00:14:14.231
I took on a perfume brand's launch event

00:14:14.288 --> 00:14:15.654
on the day after tomorrow for you.

00:14:17.334 --> 00:14:18.814
I already told you

00:14:19.478 --> 00:14:21.158
not to take on any gigs without asking me!

00:14:21.654 --> 00:14:22.704
I want to take a break.

00:14:22.814 --> 00:14:24.414
So what do you want me to do?

00:14:24.574 --> 00:14:26.174
I already accepted it!

00:14:26.214 --> 00:14:27.934
You made your bed, now lie in it.

00:14:28.254 --> 00:14:28.934
Pat!

00:14:29.174 --> 00:14:29.908
Pat!

00:14:38.334 --> 00:14:39.516
Hello, Thawat.

00:14:40.574 --> 00:14:41.574
Of course, Thawat.

00:14:42.714 --> 00:14:44.254
I'll be waiting at home.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.254
Alright.

00:14:53.054 --> 00:14:53.854
Prem,

00:14:55.974 --> 00:14:56.974
are you alright?

00:14:58.654 --> 00:15:00.934
Mm, I am.

00:15:01.334 --> 00:15:02.254
Don't worry.

00:15:02.614 --> 00:15:03.814
What a small world we live in.

00:15:04.134 --> 00:15:05.254
Out of all the restaurants,

00:15:05.854 --> 00:15:07.174
why did they have to eat here?

00:15:08.014 --> 00:15:09.334
I hope we've seen the last of them.

00:15:10.714 --> 00:15:11.807
What a demon!

00:15:11.847 --> 00:15:13.694
And the woman who crashed your wedding?

00:15:14.214 --> 00:15:15.374
With all honesty,

00:15:15.414 --> 00:15:16.734
I hate her to the bone.

00:15:21.454 --> 00:15:23.454
I wanna say I like it.

00:15:55.175 --> 00:15:56.055
Nam,

00:16:19.755 --> 00:16:21.115
I'm pretty stressed out today.

00:16:22.515 --> 00:16:24.755
Can you help take a load off my mind?

00:16:40.635 --> 00:16:42.675
I heard you went back to that guy?

00:16:43.135 --> 00:16:44.295
Where did you hear that from?

00:16:45.095 --> 00:16:46.495
Because if it's from your friend,

00:16:47.135 --> 00:16:48.478
you might need to use your discretion.

00:16:49.108 --> 00:16:50.228
Is it true, though?

00:16:50.935 --> 00:16:52.875
I don't have to confirm
or deny that with you.

00:16:53.295 --> 00:16:55.355
Well, I don't want you to go back to him.

00:16:55.895 --> 00:16:57.675
The reason you don't want me to

00:16:58.055 --> 00:16:59.715
is because you care
about your friend, right?

00:17:00.455 --> 00:17:01.675
I don't care about her.

00:17:02.575 --> 00:17:03.755
I care about you, Doc.

00:17:09.375 --> 00:17:11.075
So now you're on my side?

00:17:13.515 --> 00:17:15.115
Isn't that obvious?

00:17:19.015 --> 00:17:21.375
I know my friend has done you wrong,

00:17:21.815 --> 00:17:22.888
and I'm sorry

00:17:22.928 --> 00:17:24.475
for how she treated you.

00:17:26.495 --> 00:17:28.135
But I've never regretted

00:17:28.415 --> 00:17:30.595
breaking off your engagement to that guy.

00:17:30.935 --> 00:17:31.975
Look, Miss Pat,

00:17:33.015 --> 00:17:35.755
I don't believe that you actually like me.

00:17:36.795 --> 00:17:38.715
You're a friend of the person who hurt me.

00:17:38.935 --> 00:17:40.675
How do you expect me to trust you?

00:17:43.235 --> 00:17:45.395
I don't even know
what your intention is anymore.

00:17:46.395 --> 00:17:48.995
Are you saying
I have to prove myself to you?

00:18:09.995 --> 00:18:11.035
This bruise...

00:18:11.515 --> 00:18:13.035
She gave it to you, didn't she?

00:18:26.315 --> 00:18:35.795
♫No words needed to realize you're the one♫

00:18:36.035 --> 00:18:41.475
♫I was born to be...♫

00:18:42.435 --> 00:18:43.427
I will never let anyone

00:18:43.451 --> 00:18:45.936
leave any marks
on your beautiful arms again.

00:18:46.536 --> 00:18:53.755
♫With you by my side,
there's nothing else I'd like♫

00:18:55.115 --> 00:18:59.688
♫You're the love I'm longing for♫

00:19:00.039 --> 00:19:04.243
♫The heaven-sent one I adore♫

00:19:04.782 --> 00:19:10.743
♫The final answer to my prayers♫

00:19:13.415 --> 00:19:18.147
♫My heart will belong to you♫

00:19:18.215 --> 00:19:20.715
Are you saying
I have to prove myself to you?

00:19:38.435 --> 00:19:41.955
[Mother]

00:19:43.495 --> 00:19:45.075
Hello, Mother?

00:19:48.555 --> 00:19:49.373
Yes,

00:19:50.335 --> 00:19:51.795
I'll stop by tomorrow.

00:20:07.995 --> 00:20:09.475
What do you want to do next, Prem?

00:20:09.915 --> 00:20:12.955
Thawat has already come to speak to us.

00:20:13.595 --> 00:20:14.915
What did he say?

00:20:16.355 --> 00:20:17.795
He apologized,

00:20:18.508 --> 00:20:19.628
saying he felt guilty,

00:20:21.315 --> 00:20:22.555
and asked for another chance.

00:20:22.915 --> 00:20:23.867
What else?

00:20:24.779 --> 00:20:26.539
He told us he was drunk that day,

00:20:27.595 --> 00:20:29.715
and that it was a one-time thing.

00:20:30.195 --> 00:20:31.515
But he denied

00:20:31.995 --> 00:20:33.835
that he was the father of that child,

00:20:34.295 --> 00:20:35.995
so he will proceed with a paternity test.

00:20:36.572 --> 00:20:37.592
If it turns out

00:20:37.616 --> 00:20:39.572
that the baby is his,

00:20:40.655 --> 00:20:42.315
he will pay for child support.

00:20:42.519 --> 00:20:43.502
But...

00:20:44.435 --> 00:20:46.115
he would like another chance

00:20:46.475 --> 00:20:47.666
to start over with you.

00:20:50.915 --> 00:20:51.995
He told us

00:20:52.715 --> 00:20:54.235
he really loved you, Prem.

00:20:54.875 --> 00:20:56.915
Do you think he really loves me

00:20:57.355 --> 00:20:58.915
after what he did to me?

00:21:01.915 --> 00:21:03.828
I know you're emotional,

00:21:03.868 --> 00:21:07.469
but every single one of us
makes mistakes, dear.

00:21:08.395 --> 00:21:10.481
You must really want me to marry

00:21:10.488 --> 00:21:12.261
the man who cheated on me.

00:21:13.555 --> 00:21:15.675
Do I really have to
keep my head down, Father?

00:21:16.075 --> 00:21:18.195
Why won't you try to understand anything?

00:21:18.235 --> 00:21:19.715
Learn how to let go!

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:21.042
True, he made a mistake,

00:21:21.074 --> 00:21:23.282
but that was one time,
and he already feels bad.

00:21:23.315 --> 00:21:25.112
Is that so hard for you to forgive?

00:21:25.875 --> 00:21:27.035
Calm down, darling...

00:21:27.082 --> 00:21:28.922
I am as calm as can be!

00:21:28.947 --> 00:21:31.587
- But look at our stubborn daughter!
- I am not stubborn!

00:21:32.195 --> 00:21:33.435
I have my reasons.

00:21:33.995 --> 00:21:35.548
Even before we're married,

00:21:35.588 --> 00:21:37.788
he's made me cry
more than I ever imagined.

00:21:37.828 --> 00:21:40.195
Don't you guys think

00:21:40.235 --> 00:21:41.595
it would get even worse

00:21:41.635 --> 00:21:44.155
if we actually got married?

00:21:44.195 --> 00:21:45.595
You're just being paranoid!

00:21:46.155 --> 00:21:48.275
Couldn't you just live in the moment?

00:21:48.875 --> 00:21:50.875
I don't want you to shut yourself out.

00:21:50.915 --> 00:21:52.235
I want you to get married

00:21:52.275 --> 00:21:53.915
and build a family.

00:21:54.475 --> 00:21:56.035
I'm not ready right now.

00:21:57.275 --> 00:21:58.275
Please excuse me.

00:21:59.475 --> 00:22:00.475
Prem!

00:22:02.595 --> 00:22:04.075
Let me talk to her.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:04.780
Darling,

00:22:04.805 --> 00:22:07.045
you need to put her in her place!

00:22:11.395 --> 00:22:12.395
Prem!

00:22:12.755 --> 00:22:13.595
Prem!

00:22:13.635 --> 00:22:15.195
Wait for me!

00:22:16.628 --> 00:22:17.628
Prem...

00:22:18.643 --> 00:22:20.603
Please don't be angry at your father.

00:22:21.275 --> 00:22:22.715
He only said that

00:22:22.755 --> 00:22:24.235
because he cares so much about you.

00:22:24.515 --> 00:22:25.715
Besides,

00:22:25.995 --> 00:22:27.715
he really adores Thawat

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.340
and hates the thought of losing him.

00:22:29.855 --> 00:22:31.915
Am I not his daughter?

00:22:33.635 --> 00:22:36.275
Isn't he supposed to be on my side, Mother?

00:22:40.003 --> 00:22:41.683
This is how he always is;

00:22:42.595 --> 00:22:44.215
he never understands me!

00:22:44.305 --> 00:22:46.254
He never does!

00:23:00.235 --> 00:23:01.235
Prem!

00:23:02.535 --> 00:23:03.535
Father!

00:23:07.276 --> 00:23:09.076
I passed the violin exam!

00:23:09.367 --> 00:23:10.515
The teacher said

00:23:10.555 --> 00:23:11.888
I have a chance

00:23:11.899 --> 00:23:14.715
at applying for
the University of Music in Vienna!

00:23:16.235 --> 00:23:17.115
No more of that.

00:23:17.675 --> 00:23:18.675
Darling,

00:23:19.235 --> 00:23:20.875
what are you doing?!

00:23:22.555 --> 00:23:24.955
Who said you could apply
to a music university?

00:23:25.155 --> 00:23:26.155
Father!

00:23:26.395 --> 00:23:27.915
You will only apply for med school!

00:23:27.955 --> 00:23:29.915
Music is just a hobby,

00:23:29.955 --> 00:23:30.915
not a profession!

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.500
But I don't want to be a doctor!

00:23:33.555 --> 00:23:35.195
I want to play violin, Father.

00:23:35.235 --> 00:23:36.235
I won't allow it.

00:23:37.175 --> 00:23:39.275
You will only walk
the path I've paved for you!

00:23:41.195 --> 00:23:42.211
But...

00:23:42.315 --> 00:23:43.555
If you keep being difficult,

00:23:43.595 --> 00:23:44.808
I won't let you play it anymore!

00:23:44.833 --> 00:23:47.245
Darling, you've gone too far!

00:23:48.475 --> 00:23:50.795
She's been strictly following
your education plan.

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.042
Just for once,

00:23:52.675 --> 00:23:54.355
why couldn't you give her what she wants?

00:23:54.395 --> 00:23:56.635
You have no rights in this matter.

00:23:57.235 --> 00:23:58.988
As a mother, you're supposed
to raise a good daughter,

00:23:59.028 --> 00:24:00.955
so how come she's resistant to her father?!

00:24:00.995 --> 00:24:02.955
Please don't reprimand her, Father!

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:04.260
You'd better behave!

00:24:04.835 --> 00:24:06.035
Don't try to pick a fight with me!

00:24:11.915 --> 00:24:12.915
Dear...

00:24:14.779 --> 00:24:17.259
All I want is to play violin, Mother...

00:24:50.315 --> 00:24:51.955
Thank you, Mother!

00:25:00.955 --> 00:25:02.835
I asked Father to give it back.

00:25:03.043 --> 00:25:05.163
Play it when he's not around, alright?

00:25:08.315 --> 00:25:09.915
Thank you so much, Mother.

00:25:11.567 --> 00:25:14.195
You're the only one who understands me.

00:25:22.795 --> 00:25:24.795
I love you so, so much.

00:25:58.515 --> 00:26:00.322
Happy Birthday, Mother.

00:26:02.195 --> 00:26:03.494
Thank you, dear.

00:26:06.475 --> 00:26:07.555
Make a wish.

00:26:14.675 --> 00:26:15.515
It won't go out!

00:26:15.555 --> 00:26:16.555
Let me help.

00:26:20.971 --> 00:26:22.171
This looks good!

00:26:23.955 --> 00:26:25.555
- Prem,
- Yes?

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.300
I also have something for you.

00:26:27.675 --> 00:26:29.435
Again, Mother?

00:26:29.755 --> 00:26:31.635
Why do you always give me presents

00:26:31.784 --> 00:26:33.715
for your own birthday?

00:26:34.675 --> 00:26:36.427
Because you're such a good kid.

00:26:38.075 --> 00:26:38.575
Here.

00:26:39.383 --> 00:26:40.075
What is it?

00:26:42.348 --> 00:26:44.635
I know you've been asking
to go on a vacation.

00:26:44.875 --> 00:26:46.635
Father already gave permission.

00:26:48.235 --> 00:26:49.515
Mother!

00:26:51.315 --> 00:26:52.115
Prem,

00:26:54.474 --> 00:26:56.714
I can give you the world, you know that?

00:27:02.415 --> 00:27:04.195
Thank you, Mother.

00:27:04.835 --> 00:27:06.315
Whatever you want,

00:27:06.555 --> 00:27:08.275
just say the word.

00:27:09.535 --> 00:27:12.097
I can also give you the world.

00:28:15.496 --> 00:28:16.296
Nam,

00:28:21.456 --> 00:28:22.316
here's for you to use.

00:28:24.136 --> 00:28:25.376
Thank you, Thawat.

00:28:27.296 --> 00:28:28.296
Thawat,

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:31.136
are you leaving?

00:28:32.136 --> 00:28:32.835
Yeah.

00:28:32.991 --> 00:28:35.071
Can you not leave just yet?

00:28:35.436 --> 00:28:38.016
Let's find something delicious to eat.

00:28:38.776 --> 00:28:40.056
Please, Thawat?

00:28:41.096 --> 00:28:42.456
My darling Thawat...

00:28:57.336 --> 00:29:00.975
[I love you, dear]

00:29:05.576 --> 00:29:07.176
He would like another chance

00:29:07.576 --> 00:29:08.776
to start over with you.

00:29:09.096 --> 00:29:10.306
He told us

00:29:10.567 --> 00:29:11.994
he really loved you, Prem.

00:29:12.696 --> 00:29:14.056
True, he made a mistake,

00:29:14.096 --> 00:29:16.176
but that was one time,
and he already feels bad.

00:29:16.216 --> 00:29:18.336
Is that so hard for you to forgive?

00:29:18.376 --> 00:29:20.396
I don't want you to shut yourself out.

00:29:20.436 --> 00:29:21.776
I want you to get married

00:29:21.816 --> 00:29:23.336
and build a family.

00:29:24.299 --> 00:29:26.576
Right, I do have some skills.

00:29:30.989 --> 00:29:31.809
Prem!

00:29:33.104 --> 00:29:34.996
I can explain, Prem.

00:29:35.767 --> 00:29:37.607
I don't think that's necessary, Thawat.

00:29:39.736 --> 00:29:40.896
I already saw

00:29:41.216 --> 00:29:42.336
what I needed to see.

00:29:44.687 --> 00:29:45.770
Are you not ashamed

00:29:45.794 --> 00:29:47.196
of lying to my parents like that?!

00:29:49.151 --> 00:29:50.431
Just hold on, Sweet Prem.

00:29:50.553 --> 00:29:52.953
It's not what it looks like.

00:29:53.302 --> 00:29:54.782
We're just friends,

00:29:56.116 --> 00:29:58.096
nothing more than that.

00:29:58.336 --> 00:30:00.380
Just stop with the excuses.

00:30:00.736 --> 00:30:02.696
I'm so sick of those!

00:30:04.096 --> 00:30:05.936
I'll believe what I see.

00:30:07.416 --> 00:30:08.256
Thawat,

00:30:08.296 --> 00:30:09.856
can we go now?

00:30:09.998 --> 00:30:11.598
Just go if you can't wait!

00:30:12.976 --> 00:30:14.256
Look, Prem,

00:30:15.296 --> 00:30:17.016
the only person I love is you,

00:30:19.856 --> 00:30:21.056
no one else.

00:30:24.136 --> 00:30:26.416
But as of right now,

00:30:27.356 --> 00:30:28.360
I'm not even sure

00:30:28.384 --> 00:30:29.856
if I've ever loved you.

00:30:31.496 --> 00:30:33.313
Please stop bothering me

00:30:33.337 --> 00:30:35.136
and my parents.

00:30:38.656 --> 00:30:40.176
- Prem... Sweet Prem...
- Thawat!

00:30:40.216 --> 00:30:41.017
Thawat!

00:30:41.057 --> 00:30:42.497
Please just stay with me.

00:30:42.816 --> 00:30:43.816
Please, Thawat...

00:30:50.176 --> 00:30:51.576
I can explain, Prem.

00:30:52.536 --> 00:30:54.376
I don't think that's necessary, Thawat.

00:30:55.656 --> 00:30:56.688
I already saw

00:30:57.136 --> 00:30:58.296
what I needed to see.

00:30:58.896 --> 00:30:59.888
Are you not ashamed

00:30:59.912 --> 00:31:01.298
of lying to my parents like that?!

00:31:12.136 --> 00:31:13.199
You saw the video?

00:31:13.856 --> 00:31:14.656
Mm...

00:31:14.936 --> 00:31:16.736
Poor thing, that doctor of yours.

00:31:17.016 --> 00:31:18.616
I wonder how she's doing now.

00:32:05.256 --> 00:32:06.536
Are you that hurt?

00:32:10.136 --> 00:32:11.376
You again?

00:32:12.056 --> 00:32:14.296
Yes, it’s me again.

00:32:21.176 --> 00:32:22.616
Come on, let me help.

00:32:24.767 --> 00:32:26.648
I don't need your help!

00:32:31.936 --> 00:32:33.456
Don't be so stubborn, Doc.

00:32:33.496 --> 00:32:34.656
I'll take you home.

00:32:35.896 --> 00:32:36.896
Let go...

00:32:38.416 --> 00:32:40.216
Let go!

00:32:40.256 --> 00:32:41.376
Let go!!

00:33:01.336 --> 00:33:03.536
Do you love him that much, Doc?

00:33:05.116 --> 00:33:07.096
You're all messed up.

00:33:07.736 --> 00:33:08.896
"Love," you said?

00:33:10.336 --> 00:33:12.096
No, I'm enraged.

00:33:12.536 --> 00:33:15.256
I don't think I've ever loved
that fool to begin with!

00:33:15.896 --> 00:33:18.056
He ruined my life!

00:33:19.276 --> 00:33:21.096
It's completely falling apart.

00:33:22.495 --> 00:33:24.593
Your life is not ruined at all, Doc.

00:33:26.016 --> 00:33:27.016
It is!

00:33:28.896 --> 00:33:31.176
I've got everything planned...

00:33:32.232 --> 00:33:34.152
I graduated with honors,

00:33:35.336 --> 00:33:37.936
and now working
at the best hospital there is...

00:33:39.296 --> 00:33:42.216
I was gonna marry the right one,

00:33:43.959 --> 00:33:46.950
but it didn't go
according to plan at all...

00:33:47.976 --> 00:33:49.056
If it didn't,

00:33:49.081 --> 00:33:51.044
then just make a new one.

00:33:52.456 --> 00:33:53.856
That's easy for you to say.

00:33:54.776 --> 00:33:55.776
Right now...

00:33:57.336 --> 00:34:00.816
Everyone is saying I'm a good-for-nothing

00:34:02.769 --> 00:34:05.022
and worthless!

00:34:06.576 --> 00:34:08.696
Is that truly what I am?

00:34:09.736 --> 00:34:10.966
Answer me!

00:34:10.991 --> 00:34:12.794
Is that truly what I am?

00:34:16.536 --> 00:34:21.056
♫All I can do is hold back tears,♫

00:34:21.096 --> 00:34:23.496
♫Knowing our last days are near♫

00:34:23.521 --> 00:34:25.601
Don't listen to any of the stuff they say.

00:34:26.856 --> 00:34:28.616
It couldn't be more untrue.

00:34:30.416 --> 00:34:32.216
You're the most valuable person ever.

00:34:34.776 --> 00:34:37.936
♫I need to face reality,♫

00:34:38.456 --> 00:34:43.976
♫Even though my heart weeps internally♫

00:34:44.016 --> 00:34:47.416
♫It's painful going against my heart♫

00:34:47.456 --> 00:34:50.856
♫It's painful that we have to part♫

♫All I can say is a tearful goodbye♫

00:35:48.321 --> 00:35:49.881
How did I come back here?

00:35:54.416 --> 00:35:56.616
Don't listen to any of the stuff they say.

00:35:57.792 --> 00:35:59.552
It couldn't be more untrue.

00:36:01.416 --> 00:36:03.136
You're the most valuable person ever.

00:36:37.456 --> 00:36:39.936
Is my beautiful doctor awake by now?

00:36:41.882 --> 00:36:42.602
Pat!

00:36:45.216 --> 00:36:47.176
I've been calling since yesterday.

00:36:47.216 --> 00:36:49.151
Why didn't you pick up or even call back?

00:36:49.176 --> 00:36:50.016
I'm busy.

00:36:50.371 --> 00:36:51.371
With what?

00:36:51.816 --> 00:36:53.536
I don't think you need to know everything.

00:36:56.336 --> 00:36:57.536
And where are you going?

00:36:58.416 --> 00:37:00.816
Didn't I just tell you a second ago?

00:37:01.816 --> 00:37:03.296
Why are you here, anyway?

00:37:03.776 --> 00:37:05.696
You have an event this afternoon.

00:37:06.695 --> 00:37:08.373
I already told you

00:37:08.398 --> 00:37:09.404
I'm not taking on the gig.

00:37:09.536 --> 00:37:11.016
But I already did;

00:37:11.056 --> 00:37:12.176
what do you expect me to do?

00:37:12.216 --> 00:37:13.696
Cancel it.

00:37:13.736 --> 00:37:15.896
- I can't do that.
- And why not?

00:37:15.921 --> 00:37:18.241
They already paid us.

00:37:18.696 --> 00:37:20.296
That seems like your problem, not mine.

00:37:20.696 --> 00:37:21.615
Pat,

00:37:21.655 --> 00:37:23.696
I am your manager.

00:37:23.736 --> 00:37:26.416
Then, I'll consider you
not my manager anymore!

00:37:27.256 --> 00:37:27.976
Pat!

00:37:28.016 --> 00:37:30.216
You can't do this to me, Pat!

00:37:31.016 --> 00:37:32.376
I can't take it anymore, Nam.

00:37:32.636 --> 00:37:34.161
I'm done with everything.

00:37:34.296 --> 00:37:35.616
You lied to me

00:37:35.656 --> 00:37:37.816
that Dr. Prem forgave that bastard,

00:37:38.336 --> 00:37:40.136
and you haven't even cut ties with him!

00:37:40.776 --> 00:37:42.176
I don't know

00:37:42.736 --> 00:37:44.296
what's true or not, Nam.

00:37:45.016 --> 00:37:47.456
Have you ever been sincere with me at all?

00:38:25.696 --> 00:38:27.256
How did you know the code to my place?

00:38:29.576 --> 00:38:31.296
You told me yourself,

00:38:32.296 --> 00:38:33.656
don't you remember?

00:38:43.256 --> 00:38:45.256
What's the password, Doc?

00:38:48.016 --> 00:38:50.696
2-2-5-6.

00:39:07.016 --> 00:39:08.296
Are you sick?

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:02.970
Doc, you're burning up!

00:40:03.717 --> 00:40:05.037
I'll take your temperature.

00:40:13.397 --> 00:40:14.287
Doc?

00:40:15.997 --> 00:40:17.397
Doc?

00:40:21.237 --> 00:40:23.397
Doc...

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:27.780
Open your mouth.

00:40:29.957 --> 00:40:31.157
Doc?

00:40:33.557 --> 00:40:34.557
Open your mouth.

00:40:37.901 --> 00:40:39.121
I can do it myself.

00:40:51.157 --> 00:40:52.077
Whoa!

00:40:52.164 --> 00:40:53.884
You have a 38 °C fever!

00:40:55.717 --> 00:40:56.637
It's fine.

00:40:56.677 --> 00:40:58.037
I'll take a fever reducer.

00:40:58.537 --> 00:40:59.717
Let me find it for you.

00:41:02.037 --> 00:41:03.757
No, I can do it.

00:41:04.037 --> 00:41:05.437
Let me do it.

00:41:05.757 --> 00:41:07.317
I can find it myself.

00:41:07.957 --> 00:41:09.037
Doc,

00:41:09.437 --> 00:41:12.037
after spending almost all night together,

00:41:12.997 --> 00:41:14.877
you still don't trust me?

00:41:29.037 --> 00:41:38.757
♫No words needed to realize you're the one♫

00:41:38.797 --> 00:41:48.677

Or do I need to feed it to you?

00:42:03.997 --> 00:42:05.269
There's no need for that.

I'm sorry, Doc.

Don't look.

♫Do you feel the same, I wonder?♫

00:46:55.757 --> 00:46:59.966

♫I've just realized
why everyone says it heals♫

00:47:50.088 --> 00:47:56.717
♫Each time your arms wrap around me,
it sinks in beautifully♫

Take a nap, Doc.

00:49:13.317 --> 00:49:15.637
You'll be good as new after you wake up.

I am.

00:51:07.817 --> 00:51:09.157
That's a relief.

00:51:09.489 --> 00:51:11.949
Your fever didn't go down until 10 P.M.

00:51:15.837 --> 00:51:17.077
Get more sleep.

00:51:17.397 --> 00:51:19.757
Are you letting me sleep over?

00:51:19.797 --> 00:51:21.037
Just for tonight.

00:51:22.177 --> 00:51:23.357
Who knows?

00:51:24.597 --> 00:51:27.013
There might be some other nights.

00:51:28.302 --> 00:51:29.313
There won't.

00:51:29.917 --> 00:51:31.165
If you'll excuse me,

00:51:31.267 --> 00:51:32.882
I need to go to work early tomorrow.

00:51:38.757 --> 00:51:40.317
Do you believe now

00:51:40.877 --> 00:51:42.277
that I'm genuinely into you

00:51:43.261 --> 00:51:44.887

♫You're the love I'm longing for♫

00:52:25.357 --> 00:52:26.739
Is it even possible

00:52:26.837 --> 00:52:28.536
to go from hating each other

00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:30.794
to falling completely in love?

00:52:31.497 --> 00:52:34.717
Love is unpredictable.

00:52:34.917 --> 00:52:35.942
Love is love.

00:52:36.201 --> 00:52:37.222
There's no reason

00:52:37.247 --> 00:52:38.277
why you love someone.

00:52:38.444 --> 00:52:39.846
If you find the right person,

00:52:39.994 --> 00:52:40.978
your gut will tell you.

00:52:41.277 --> 00:52:43.076
Your heart's gonna beat like crazy.

00:52:43.101 --> 00:52:44.333
Have you been there?
