[The Guardians]

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.920
[Episode 23]

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.100
Ding Yi, Ding Yi!

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.900
What on earth are you trying to do?

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.740
The frequency of the quartz crystal
in this radio

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.100
matches the one used
by the Communist Party.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.820
Whoever has this radio
is a Communist spy.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.620
What are you really after?

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.180
Who is it?

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.850
Lee...

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.340
Director Lee.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.940
Director Lee.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.410
Your eyes...

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.380
I'm an agent
of the Shanghai Underground Communist Party.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.690
I'm assigned to get you out.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.100
This morning, Comrade Biyun
didn't contact you

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.100
because we had to report
to our superiors first.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.100
Now Comrade Biyun has been attacked,

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.220
which means both your identities

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.410
have already been exposed.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.410
The next target in danger

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.820
could very well be you.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.100
So the Organization ordered me
to meet you

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.380
and get you out of here.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.980
Your ride will be here any moment,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.260
waiting on Robison Road.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.850
This is your only shot to leave.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.100
Come with me.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.260
In a moment, the vehicle picking you up

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.220
will take you to the intel post

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.260
of Shanghai Underground Communist Party.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.820
Inside this bag are files

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.980
I smuggled out of
the Cryptography Institute,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.450
classified and highly sensitive.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.850
You must get them into their hands.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.940
Our leaders

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.980
will be there waiting for you.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.780
Comrade Bai Ye,

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.730
we can't waste another second.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.500
Move.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.660
Hold on a second.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.380
This way.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.100
Hurry.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:04:00.760
[Robison Rd]

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.540
This is Robison Road.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.340
The car will be here any moment.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.380
Once it arrives, you go right away.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.370
Don't worry about us.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.100
Got your gun with you?

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.780
Aren't you coming with me?

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.020
We still have an important mission.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.220
Here comes the car.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.140
Comrade.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.980
See you in Yan'an.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.540
Yan'an?

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.250
Don't look back.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.700
Let's go.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.460
Gu Yangshan.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.810
You don't need to say anything.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.540
I know what you're doing.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.850
You only have one goal.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.780
To protect Shen Wanqing's identity
as a Communist.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.730
But do you really think
Liang Jingyuan will believe you?

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.580
Yi Aida works for him.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.050
Now the radio's in Yi Aida's hands.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.170
That proves she's a Communist spy.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.050
It's solid evidence.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.290
Even if Yi Aida was just bait
set by Liang Jingyuan,

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.460
she's dead now,

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.220
which means there's no way to testify.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.810
If next,

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.700
we get the chance to meet Sasaki,

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.900
we can prove to him

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.580
that Liang Jingyuan runs a loose ship.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.850
Because there's a Communist spy
in his team.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.340
You're being too naive.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.900
Why would he even let you meet Sasaki?

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.540
He'll never let you see Sasaki.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.050
Aidaâ€¦ Aidaâ€¦

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.020
Aida.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.370
Liang Jingyuan!

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.700
You jerk!

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.050
Now,

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.460
lock down Sanyangli.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.610
It's going to be a battle of minds.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.020
Sasaki won't give Liang Jingyuan
much time.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.290
As long as we endure
Liang Jingyuan's questioning,

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.730
and he can't find evidence from us,

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.250
he will have to swallow the bitter end.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.340
One night.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.250
I'm giving you just one night.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.780
Sanyangli has already been locked down.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.580
I'm requesting permission
to use force on Joseph Lee.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.340
What are

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.580
the consequences?

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.730
The consequence is

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.900
that I can help you

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.460
wipe out the Tonoji family's influence

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.890
from the New Government's
intelligence network.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.220
Good.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.220
You have my permission to interrogate.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.340
But if you haven't found the enemy spy
by sunrise,

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.580
everyone in the Cryptography Institute

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.220
will be gone.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.220
That includes you.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:14.680
Fine.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.580
Since you have such a flawless plan,

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.220
you won't be needing me anymore.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.300
You've already made the choice
you wanted to make.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:31.850
Don't worry.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.340
I didn't kill Shen Wanqing.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.340
And I'll never betray him.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.770
What I owe you,

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.460
I'll return to you.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:11.250
Mr. Shen.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.460
Mr. Shen.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.850
Mr. Shen.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.730
Mr. Shen.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.700
Mr. Shen.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.180
Slow down.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.340
Mr. Shen.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.580
Mr. Shen, listen to me.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.820
I've already taken care of your radio.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.490
I had Yi Aida carry your radio,

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:34.730
and she was killed by the Japanese.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.340
That confirmed her as a Communist.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.300
But Yi Aida worked for Liang Jingyuan.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.980
He'll lock down Sanyangli at once

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.340
and conduct a full investigation.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.850
As long as we can endure the questioning

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:45.180
and reveal no flaws,

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.220
we still have a chance
to turn things around.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.980
Then we can get your intel out.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:53.420
Mr. Shen,

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.490
I'm not Joseph Lee at all.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.730
My name is Ding Yi,

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.220
an actor from the Chaosheng Troupe.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.370
Ms. Xian, Xian Biyun,

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:03.940
was the one who recommended me to join.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.850
Sanyangli goes into lockdown.
And shut the gates.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.340
No one is allowed to leave.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:11.940
Comrade Bai Ye.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.850
Don't hesitate.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:14.850
I've already

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.180
laid all my cards on the table.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:17.130
Now,

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.100
you have to trust me.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.580
Steps, steps, steps.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.460
Director Lee.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:49.850
Director Lee.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.820
Mr. Shen, you're here too.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.300
What's going on here?

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.700
Director Liang.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.820
Interesting.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.700
Searching for the radio
led right to my own place.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.530
The Institute has been compromised.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.580
Japan Army in Shanghai.
New Government.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.100
How many people will lose sleep tonight?

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.300
My life

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.580
and yours

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.300
all depend on tonight's investigation.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.180
Come on.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.980
I'd like to hear your suggestions.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.100
So who exactly is this mole?

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.300
Whoever has the radio is the mole.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.580
Go check the radio.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.220
You're not wrong.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.420
The radio was with Miss Yi Aida.

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:07.820
But she was not the one.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.180
Someone tricked her into trusting them.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.100
They had her take the radio
out of Sanyangli.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.820
This enemy spy is cunning.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.730
Director Liang, do you have proof?

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:22.180
To prove that she's not the enemy spy?

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.100
Because I trust her.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.700
It's that simple.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.100
Today, only you guys were in Sanyangli.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.180
The signal detected
by the direction finder

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.820
was at 6:03 p.m.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.300
I just want to ask

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.180
what were you doing at that time?

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:42.340
Director Liang,

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:44.420
are you interrogating me now?

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.820
I'm just asking a question.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.130
If you refuse to cooperate,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.100
you could take it as an interrogation.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.300
I was at home

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.650
going through today's work notes

00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:59.650
and I dozed off reading them.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.980
Li Huan and I were home resting too.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.300
I came back from the hospital,

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.420
helping Charlie pack clothes for Biyun,

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.700
getting them ready for the hospital.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.580
And then you showed up, Director Liang.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:16.650
And you?

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:21.460
Director Liang,

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.580
I asked Mr. Lee for leave
early this morning.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.580
I caught a cold,

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.460
so I requested to rest at home.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.420
I was lying in bed

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.700
when Mr. Lee suddenly came back.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.460
He said his wife has been shot.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.820
I rushed to help Mr. Lee pack things.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:38.420
And that's it.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:44.770
Director Liang.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.220
Could you please hurry?

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.300
My wife's still in surgery
at the hospital.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.100
Alright.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.850
So you're all saying
you're in the clear.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.100
I'm afraid you'll have to bear with us.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.700
Wait here for a moment.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.490
Once we have the results,

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:03.460
I'll update you right away.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.420
Amu, take Li Yu over there first.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.100
What's going on?

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.700
Why are you taking me?

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.100
No.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:11.580
What are you doing?

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.460
Why are you targeting me?

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.300
Yu, Yu...

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.300
I'm not a mole!

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:14.940
I'm not a mole.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:15.340
Master.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.580
Huan, come back! Huan!

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.940
Why are you arresting me?

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.100
Let go!

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:19.700
Huan, come back!

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.100
Let go!

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:20.940
Why are you taking me in?

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.100
Director Liang.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.220
No need to rush.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.300
There's an order. Everyone gets a turn.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.940
Of course.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.650
I also welcome you

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.300
to knock on that door and report it.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.980
I'll be inside waiting anytime.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.100
This is pure nonsense!

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:42.580
I'm going to the hospital
to see my wife now.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.580
Charlie, let's go.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:44.940
If you're that anxious,

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.980
I can send someone
to bring her here right now.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:47.980
Do you think that's okay?

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.220
Director Liang!

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.330
Director Liang...

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:09.620
You know me well.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.860
Li Huan and I were home all night.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.050
Master can vouch for me.

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.940
I...

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.460
The whole night I...

00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:25.980
Never left my table.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.290
Sit there.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:17:59.660
Want some coffee?

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.530
Let's begin.

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:05.730
What do you mean?

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.980
What do you mean?

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.860
Huan.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.730
Yu!

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:38.660
Yu!

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:39.810
Huan.

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:40.900
Help!

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.620
Yu!

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.220
Huan.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:42.730
Yu!

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:43.620
Huan.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.460
Director Liang!

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.220
Director Liang!

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.220
Please, don't hurt him.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.730
He doesn't know anything.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:50.660
Yu!

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.460
Huan.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.220
Director Liang, Director Liang,
Director Liang.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.290
Please don't hurt my brother.

00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:59.530
My brother really knows nothing.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.250
He's not the enemy spy.

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:03.220
I beg you, stop.

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:04.980
Yu!

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.460
Yu!

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.980
Director Liang, he's just a kid.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:08.900
Director Liang.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.980
Director Liang.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.050
I'm not a mole!

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:13.220
Director Liang.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.530
Stop hitting him.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.660
Don't hurt him anymore!

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:18.900
You can't do this, Director Liang.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:20.460
Director Liang.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.140
Yu.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.460
You can't do this, Director Liang!

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.290
Director Liang.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:27.900
Yu.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.660
Yu.

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:33.180
Master.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.010
Master.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:37.980
Huan.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:40.660
Huan.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.490
Huan.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.460
Yu.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.180
What happened?

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:29.940
Yu.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:31.530
Yu.

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:32.460
Yu!

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:33.980
Yu!

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.900
Let me through!

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:36.900
Yu!

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.980
Let me pass!

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:38.940
Yu!

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.050
Yu.

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:44.050
Let me through!

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.090
Yu!

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:46.220
Huan.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.530
Liang Jingyuan!
You're playing with lives here.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:01.900
I'm going to report you to the Colonel.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.290
Director Lee, please don't rush.

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.250
It's cleaned up inside.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:07.980
Your turn now.

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:27.530
Do you know when I first

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.050
started suspecting you?

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.900
It was when we first met

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.460
and you said "to snap up a bargain".

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.570
I honestly never expected

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:45.730
that Takeda and I
would fight to the bitter end.

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:46.770
In the end,

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.660
you managed to snap up a bargain.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:52.980
Snap up a bargain?

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:56.460
I didn't expect you to be so familiar

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.290
with local antique trade slang

00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:59.250
after living overseas for so many years.

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:01.660
Are you originally from the north?

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:04.980
Also,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.980
when Xian Biyun first arrived
in Sanyangli...

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.730
Joseph Lee.

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:14.620
Joseph.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.900
I know this woman well.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.980
She would never marry you for money.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.730
So I'm really curious.

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:30.380
What exactly did she see in you?

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.420
Don't tell me
it's because you can't see.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.250
You brought me here,

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:43.900
just so you could listen to

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.620
my love story?

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.420
Let me be very clear with you.

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:52.050
My love story

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:53.730
is nothing short of tragic

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:55.620
because my fiance

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.420
is fighting for her life

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:58.730
in the hospital.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.770
Yet here you are, refusing to let me go.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.620
Liang Jingyuan.

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:08.420
I am the sworn son of the Grand Duke

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.530
and you still suspect me
of being an enemy spy.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:14.330
This is a grave insult

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:15.770
to the Tonoji family!

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.530
Let me tell you,

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.700
I will never cooperate with you.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.460
I want to see the Colonel right now.

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:26.730
No problem.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.770
But until you give your statement,

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:32.290
you won't be seeing the Colonel.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.860
Because those are the Colonel's orders.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:44.250
What is it you really want?

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.140
You already said it.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:50.810
The Grand Duke's sworn son.

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:51.940
As long as you cooperate,

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.460
I won't make things hard for you.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.660
But honestly,

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.460
I'd love to see you refuse.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.490
Back to the point.

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:10.530
Now then,

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.660
let me share my theory.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:15.460
If anything sounds off,

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.810
please correct me.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.250
The Colonel got word

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.420
that the enemy spy, Bai Ye,
would meet at the Exchange.

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:28.250
But when I got there,

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:30.460
I saw Xian Biyun and you.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:33.770
But that's fine.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:36.940
Whether it was back at the Exchange

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:38.980
or later at the checkup,

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.980
they were part of my secret search
for Bai Ye.

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:44.460
Just didn't expect

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.940
that Bai Ye would be so cunning.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.810
He must know I'm looking for him.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.330
So he hid his stomach problem.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.530
But I believe,

00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:58.420
a fellow comrade

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.730
would never abandon another comrade.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.620
Even though I haven't found Bai Ye,

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:07.810
it's still good to find his contact.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:10.290
So,

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.660
I had Yi Aida pose as Bai Ye.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:21.050
She showed up
in front of you a few times

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:22.700
to lure you into making contact.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:23.730
But I didn't expect

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.770
that tonight in Sanyangli,

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:28.900
a radio actually appeared.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.940
Turns out, Bai Ye really

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.900
is right here in our institute.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.620
He must've gotten anxious
waiting for his contact.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.660
Couldn't hold it any longer.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.460
And Director Lee,

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:42.730
you're likely covering for him.

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:44.940
Then may I ask you something.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.490
The person, Bai Ye, you just mentioned.

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:54.330
When he was sending the signal,

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:56.900
my fiance was on emergency treatment.

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:59.250
And I am blind.

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:00.530
I can't see a thing.

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:03.660
So how could I possibly cover for him?

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.460
You're not wrong.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.460
You can't see anything.

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:09.980
But you have Charlie.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.290
If we go by your logic,

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:17.290
the whole Tonoji family is enemy spies.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.460
It's hard to say they're all family.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:30.980
Yes.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.700
Biyun is still my fiance.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:42.250
That doesn't exactly make us family.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.900
You know that's not what I meant.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.530
I think Xian Biyun is using
Mrs. Lee's name

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.530
to carry out enemy spy activities.

00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:59.460
Pure nonsense.

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.730
Director Lee,

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.700
feel what's under your seat right now.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.380
When I was at your place,

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.730
I stumbled upon something interesting.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.530
If you two are really a married couple

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.380
and share the same bed every night,

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:37.530
why is only one side
of the mattress sunken in,

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.730
while the other side looks brand new,

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:42.530
like no one's ever slept on it?

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:46.290
Did you two sleep stacked
on top of each other?

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.620
You've got a dirty mind!

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:15.050
Mind giving me a reasonable explanation?

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:26.940
What they really want

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:29.980
is nothing but what's mine.

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:33.730
I'm going to become

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:35.700
your worst nightmare

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:38.730
for the rest of your life.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.220
As expected, you see every detail.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:30:59.980
Biyun and I

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:03.420
haven't actually shared the same bed.

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:10.380
Because I'm a devoted Christian.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:11.770
Before marriage,

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.220
we can't cross the line.

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:33.530
Christian? No problem.

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:35.420
Then why make it look like

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.380
you were living together?

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:39.700
The bathroom had items for both of you,

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.220
stuff you clearly shared.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.770
Was it Mrs. Lee,
with her eye for detail,

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:47.900
who taught you that?

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.140
At first, I did share a bed with Biyun.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:54.860
You know how men are.

00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:59.090
We all have moments
when our minds wander.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.980
To keep my boundaries,

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.140
I moved to Charlie's room within days.

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:07.980
As for you saying just now

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.420
that her bathroom had traces of my life,

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.220
that's pretty normal.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.980
Charlie's room does too.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.420
His cabinet even has my towel in it.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.700
You've really thought this through.

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:36.490
But that's alright.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.250
The night is still long.

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:41.900
We can take our time.

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:43.980
I've got all the time I need.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:54.900
Mr. Lee.

00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.900
Mr. Lee, are you alright?

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.050
My turn now?

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.290
Just be honest, and God will bless you.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.660
Director Liang.

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:43.980
Have a seat.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.770
You look unwell. Have something warm.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:02.860
Sit, sit.

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:13.610
I'll get straight to the point.

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.740
How much does Director Lee
pay you each month?

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:23.380
Why are you asking that, Director Liang?

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.300
I'm just curious.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:30.380
What's the price tag to

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.260
buy loyalty from someone like you?

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:41.740
I need to avenge my brother.

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:45.980
Huan, Huan.

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:48.420
Your brother is gone.

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:52.130
You have to keep living well.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.490
You must survive, no matter what.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.940
Do you remember

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.170
what I once said to you?

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.530
You have to listen to me.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.170
Put it on.

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:55.530
I've been watching you for a while.

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:57.570
Some of Director Lee's work

00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:59.340
was actually done by you.

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:00.860
Yes, that's true.

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:02.380
To be honest, your skills

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.340
are no worse than the experts out there.

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.340
But here's the thing.

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:11.530
If evidence confirms

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:13.260
Director Lee's betrayal,

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:15.490
that's on him, not you.

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:18.130
The position of director
of the Institute

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:19.530
will be kept open for you.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.300
Thank you for your trust, Mr. Liang.

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.940
In chaotic times like these,

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.530
who would want to be the hunted deer?

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:34.650
Everyone's chasing an official title,

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:35.740
trying to be a predator instead.

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:41.570
Sit.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:43.980
Please, have a seat.

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.940
To be honest with you, Mr. Liang,

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:54.530
I've wanted the director's job
for a while.

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:56.130
But...

00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:59.530
that doesn't mean

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:02.530
we can accuse Mr. Lee
of being an enemy spy.

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:04.340
He can't even see.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.050
How could he possibly send a telegram?

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:07.090
And what about Xian Biyun?

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:10.460
Those two share a lot of secrets.

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:13.340
If those secrets ever came to light,

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.530
you'd be dragged into it too.

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:22.460
They're a couple
talking behind closed doors.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.300
Why shouldn't I be told those secrets?

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.780
I'm just an outsider, right?

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.820
Have you noticed

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.490
any unusual details about their life?

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.380
Mr. Liang, what would you call

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.780
an unusual detail?

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.780
Are they close in daily life?

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.460
Close? Of course they're close.

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:49.650
Yes.

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:50.530
Before his wife came,

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:54.170
Mr. Lee's meals, sleep,
even bathroom visits,

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:55.530
were all taken care of by me, right?

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:57.380
I was with him all the time.

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:58.610
Then things changed.

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:00.570
Once his wife arrived,
I was like furniture.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.130
Do they argue often?

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:04.300
Argue? Of course they do.

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.460
One's from here, one's from abroad.

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:08.130
Their values are just different.

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:10.570
What time do they usually
sleep and wake?

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.380
That's not very consistent.

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:15.530
Usually, Mrs. Lee goes to bed
and gets up early.

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:16.860
While Mr. Lee works,

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.260
I follow his schedule,
staying up and sleeping in.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.090
Director Lee has a brain condition.

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:22.530
When his illness flares up,

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:25.050
does it disturb Mrs. Lee's rest?

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:29.820
Mr. Liang,

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.740
the things you're asking me about

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.490
are all what happens
behind closed doors.

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:35.090
How would I know, right?

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.980
What if I really need to know?

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.820
Mr. Liang, let me think a bit more.

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:07.530
Let me think again.

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.260
Just be honest

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:53.420
and God will bless you.

00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:58.530
Fine, I'll tell you the truth.

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:00.570
They never lived under the same roof.

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.050
How do you know that?

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.380
Mr. Lee is a Christian.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.820
Before marriage,
he'd never slept with his wife.

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.610
He's always sharing a room with me.

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:14.460
But you know, stuff like thisâ€¦

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.610
You can't really tell anyone.

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.980
I mean, all the neighbors think

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.380
they're madly in love.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:21.740
So why don't they live together?

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:23.820
Is there something wrong with that part?

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:24.980
How would he save his face?

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.570
That's why... I kept quiet about it.

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:29.900
But Mr. Liang,

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:32.460
to help you catch that enemy spy,

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.820
I've told you everything I know.

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:35.530
Just don't say it came from me,

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:37.900
or my life would be over.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:42.610
Mr. Liang.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.300
Not sure if this counts

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:48.570
as an unusual detail.

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:42.380
Mr. Lee.

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:43.460
Charlie.

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:44.820
I'm back.

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:48.980
Slow down.

00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:57.980
Master.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.820
I'll be straight with you.

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:12.380
The enemy spy now comes down to

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.820
you or Joseph Lee.

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:16.610
Tell me.

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:19.780
Is it him, or is it you?

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:22.780
Director Liang.

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.610
I don't know what method you used,

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:28.090
but somehow you narrowed the suspect

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:30.740
down to just me and Director Lee.

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:32.740
But I can say with certainty,

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:35.260
that person is definitely not me.

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:39.820
You know,

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.780
I'm a conflict-avoiding kind of guy,

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.380
and honestly, I lack ambition.

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:47.050
My hobbies outside of work

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:49.130
are all trivial and harmless.

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:50.820
Making it to this position today,

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.530
I'm already more than content.

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:54.530
I just want to work here,

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:56.820
steadily until I retire,

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.900
asking for nothing else.

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:02.900
Being called an enemy spy

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.260
is too much for me.

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:06.610
When the enemy spy was meeting someone,

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:08.300
you just happened to be out.

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:10.530
When the telegram was sent,

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:12.860
you happened to be in Sanyangli.

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:17.460
Why do all the coincidences involve you?

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.820
You were gone
from the Institute all day.

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:21.610
Don't tell me

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:23.530
you were out somewhere wasting the day.

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:30.980
I do have reasons I can't speak of.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.720
â™ªFlames dancing aloneâ™ª

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:54.410
â™ªBroken candle waxâ™ª

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.300
â™ªHolding onto the warmthâ™ª

00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:59.860
â™ªEyes tinted red with lightâ™ª

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.150
â™ªFlickering dimnessâ™ª

00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:03.840
â™ªA lonely little lampâ™ª

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.860
â™ªFlowers cradle morning dewâ™ª

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:09.000
â™ªCracked skinâ™ª

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.740
â™ªTurns back into earthâ™ª

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:14.130
â™ªWhen the sun risesâ™ª

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:15.670
â™ªThat very first lightâ™ª

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:17.740
â™ªWill dance for meâ™ª

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:21.230
â™ªHome lost in the mistâ™ª

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:23.160
â™ªNowhere to goâ™ª

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.070
â™ªAnd nowhere to retreatâ™ª

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:28.500
â™ªI swallowed the pain againâ™ª

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:30.610
â™ªA real life or a play?â™ª

00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:32.490
â™ªIt's hard to tellâ™ª

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.780
â™ªWhere does the wind go?â™ª

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:37.790
â™ªWhose window does it shake?â™ª

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:39.620
â™ªIt whispers softlyâ™ª

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:42.930
â™ªIt rustles in my heartâ™ª

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:45.060
â™ªMaybe you or maybe meâ™ª

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:46.650
â™ªCaught in the sorrowâ™ª

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:49.920
â™ªSomeone keeps the watchâ™ª

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:52.850
â™ªOn the vast plainsâ™ª

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:57.290
â™ªTears gently fallâ™ª

00:44:57.530 --> 00:45:00.950
â™ªCracked wounds linger onâ™ª

00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:04.210
â™ªSomeone keeps the watchâ™ª

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:07.880
â™ªWandering in the shadowsâ™ª

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:10.760
â™ªNightfall closes inâ™ª

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:15.310
â™ªWhen we turn back, dawn appearsâ™ª

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:17.500
â™ªSomeone keeps the watchâ™ª

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:21.760
â™ªOn the vast plainsâ™ª

00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:25.110
â™ªTears gently fallâ™ª

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:29.600
â™ªCracked wounds linger onâ™ª

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:32.990
â™ªSomeone keeps the watchâ™ª

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:36.640
â™ªWandering in the shadowsâ™ª

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:39.640
â™ªNightfall closes inâ™ª

00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:43.880
â™ªWhen we turn back, dawn appearsâ™ª

00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:46.500
â™ªNightfall closes inâ™ª

00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:52.670
â™ªWhen we turn back, dawn appearsâ™ª
