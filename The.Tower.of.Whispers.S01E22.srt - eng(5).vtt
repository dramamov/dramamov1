[The Tower of Whispers]

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.310
[Episode 22]

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.510
[Fengman House]

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.570
Your Majesty, please leave here for now.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.240
Just entrust Her Grace to me.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.940
Just as I expected,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.520
the venomous worm is consuming
your blood essence more rapidly.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.980
Do you still
have any Heart-Binding Poison?

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.620
Yes, I do.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.000
But it took me 10 years

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.270
to cultivate this venomous worm
with blood essence.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.650
If you need it now,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.240
there isn't enough time.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.300
Well, is there any way

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.820
to cultivate it within a day?

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:14.750
That's not okay.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.680
In that way, it would accelerate
the depletion of your body.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.370
The consequences would be unimaginable.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.490
So you mean

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.780
there is such a method?

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:21.940
Sang Li, no matter what,

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.340
I must give it a try.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.070
Sang Li.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.160
Tell me honestly,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.930
with my current health,

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.390
how much longer I can stay alive.

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.790
You're like a lamp running out of its oil.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.650
You may die within these few days.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.340
I thought
I could stay alive for a few more days.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.450
Sang Li.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.420
Regarding this matter,

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.350
please don't tell Jun Che about it.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.930
I'm afraid if he knows I'm dying,

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.880
he'll definitely go crazy again.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.440
Even if I don't tell him now,

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.000
he would still go crazy.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.600
As soon as you pass away,

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.600
he would die with you immediately.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.720
I have a way to ensure that

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.090
after I pass away,

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.920
he will no longer go crazy again.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.660
Sang Li, please trust me one more time.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.000
At this point,

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.660
no matter what you ask for,
I'll say yes to you.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.579
Sang Li.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.130
My brother
has a straightforward personality

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.650
and is inarticulate.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.880
But he is a very good person.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.780
Thank you, Your Grace.

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.960
Your Majesty.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.880
Her Grace is not seriously ill.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.630
She just needs to rest quietly.

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:41.460
Yingying.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.159
What's wrong, Your Majesty?

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:50.690
Don't call me Your Majesty.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:51.790
Call me Five.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.370
Well, Five,

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.690
what's wrong?

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.440
Just now, Sang Li insisted
that I should go out.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.870
I thought
something bad had happened to you.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.090
Fortunately, you're not seriously ill.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.460
If there had been bad news,

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.840
what would you do?

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.590
By searching the whole world,

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.470
I don't believe
I can't find the medicine to cure you.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.360
What if my fate is just like this,

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.060
and it's hard to defy Heaven's will?

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.790
Then I'll go against Heaven.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.860
I'll sacrifice my own life.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.560
If you're gone,
it'll be meaningless for me to stay alive.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.890
I'd rather go to the netherworld with you.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.210
Anyway, you're not allowed to leave me.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.350
How long have I been teaching you?

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.290
Why are you still so stubborn?

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:40.610
A leopard

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.190
cannot change its spots.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.820
So you're despising me now?

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.170
How would I despise you, Five?

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:46.650
I'm just joking.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.090
This joke of yours

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.220
is really deadly to me.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.900
Your life has always belonged to me.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.820
However,

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.930
besides your life,

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.870
I also want something else.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.130
Since you became the emperor,

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.660
we haven't gone out to have fun
for a long time.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.260
After the court meetnig tomorrow,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.660
can you have fun with me
outside the palace?

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.010
No.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.130
You haven't fully recovered yet.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.810
I'm fine now.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.690
Keeping me confined
won't help me get better.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:16.840
The answer is still no.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.110
The weather will be bad tomorrow.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.670
How can you know whether

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.040
tomorrow's weather will be fine or not?

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.120
In brief, for the foreseeable future,

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.850
the weather will always be bad.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.270
Then let's just wait
till the weather becomes fine

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.270
before Your Majesty can come see me.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.940
I understand.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.680
Now Your Majesty's status is so noble

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.580
that we can't have fun
in the marketplace anymore.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.050
I really can never defeat you.

I've experienced

In my previous life,

during the Lantern Festival
in the 28th year of Tianchen,

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:49.510
my father was framed by Ding Huairen
and put into prison.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:52.750
After that,
I lost all my family one after another.

In my previous life,

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:05.440
you were a tyrant,

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:12.090
and I died because of that.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.860
No wonder when you first met me,

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.550
you used those little tricks
to bully me and vent your anger.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.380
I'm sorry, Five.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.830
That's because in my previous life,

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:34.300
you were so detestable.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.190
No, there's no need to apologize.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.150
You thought I was detestable,

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:39.720
and that was all my fault.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.330
Five.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.020
I know you like how I'm

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:47.290
so enterprising

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.050
and capable.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:52.030
But I wasn't like that at first.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:53.760
At that time,

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:55.980
I was such a coward.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:57.980
That's why in this life,

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.090
I want to change myself so desperately.

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.270
No, Yingying.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.270
What I like

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:05.910
is every aspect of you,

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.440
the one
who took me to eat sugar figurines

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.670
and watch fireworks.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.910
I like all your mundane wishes.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.780
As long as I remain who I am,

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:17.910
no matter how many more lifetimes pass,

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:19.440
I will always love you.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.250
It's just that I'm lucky enough
in this life.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:24.670
Coincidentally,

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:26.670
you love me, too.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.150
Five.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:32.670
Yingying!
