Actually,

00:01:56.177 --> 00:01:57.097
our last vacation

00:01:57.858 --> 00:01:58.858
was our honeymoon.

00:02:08.057 --> 00:02:09.538
I need to tell you something.

00:02:10.138 --> 00:02:11.698
Jiang Liang invested in Yan Studio.

00:02:12.057 --> 00:02:12.538
He...

00:02:12.578 --> 00:02:13.337
Jiang Liang?

00:02:15.177 --> 00:02:16.177
What does he know?

00:02:16.858 --> 00:02:18.138
He relies on his sister.

00:02:19.298 --> 00:02:20.657
He doesn't do anything.

00:02:20.657 --> 00:02:21.418
He's no good.

00:02:22.258 --> 00:02:23.937
He gave me some advice

00:02:24.657 --> 00:02:25.978
that was quite practical.

00:02:26.378 --> 00:02:27.777
He's not so clueless.

00:02:28.337 --> 00:02:29.098
When did he

00:02:29.418 --> 00:02:30.418
give you advice?

00:02:31.337 --> 00:02:32.057
A month ago.

00:02:32.457 --> 00:02:33.497
I ran into him

00:02:33.497 --> 00:02:34.177
at the cafe.

00:02:34.617 --> 00:02:35.497
A month ago?

00:02:36.138 --> 00:02:36.897
Why didn't you

00:02:36.937 --> 00:02:38.177
tell me you needed funds?

00:02:39.418 --> 00:02:40.457
Back then...

00:02:44.298 --> 00:02:45.457
Why would I tell you?

00:02:50.018 --> 00:02:50.617
Who am I

00:02:51.617 --> 00:02:52.418
to you?

00:02:55.897 --> 00:02:56.418
Yeah.

00:02:57.818 --> 00:02:58.937
I shouldn't interfere.

00:02:59.858 --> 00:03:01.177
I should thank you.

00:03:02.578 --> 00:03:03.538
You secured funding

00:03:04.378 --> 00:03:05.337
from an investor.

00:03:06.057 --> 00:03:07.418
That's why you're helping

00:03:07.897 --> 00:03:09.418
your soon-to-be ex-husband

00:03:10.217 --> 00:03:11.457
for some pocket money.

00:03:12.457 --> 00:03:13.897
How noble of you.

00:03:15.258 --> 00:03:16.057
Do you have to

00:03:16.057 --> 00:03:17.418
be so sarcastic?

00:03:22.698 --> 00:03:23.937
I don't want to argue.

00:03:24.258 --> 00:03:25.217
Let's be serious.

00:03:25.818 --> 00:03:27.057
Before I agreed

00:03:27.057 --> 00:03:28.177
to help you,

00:03:29.978 --> 00:03:30.858
I had been

00:03:30.858 --> 00:03:31.818
at my wits' end.

00:03:32.418 --> 00:03:32.978
Jiang Liang

00:03:32.978 --> 00:03:33.858
introduced me

00:03:34.538 --> 00:03:35.777
to a photographer.

00:03:35.978 --> 00:03:36.538
But he didn't

00:03:36.538 --> 00:03:37.578
promise to invest.

00:03:37.818 --> 00:03:39.737
My sister called me just now,
saying that

00:03:39.858 --> 00:03:40.457
Jiang Liang saw

00:03:40.457 --> 00:03:41.217
the latest video

00:03:41.217 --> 00:03:42.217
and decided to invest.

00:03:42.617 --> 00:03:44.018
I told you immediately.

00:03:44.657 --> 00:03:45.818
Isn't that prompt enough?

00:03:52.897 --> 00:03:53.617
True.

00:03:56.018 --> 00:03:58.298
I lied about having investors

00:03:58.858 --> 00:03:59.698
the other night.

00:04:08.978 --> 00:04:09.858
Ms. Xu.

00:04:10.057 --> 00:04:11.818
You're such an impressive actress.

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:13.538
Who knows what other lies

00:04:13.538 --> 00:04:14.258
you've told?

00:04:24.578 --> 00:04:25.217
I've told

00:04:25.217 --> 00:04:26.097
a million lies.

00:04:28.378 --> 00:04:28.938
I had a fever

00:04:29.417 --> 00:04:30.618
when I interviewed you

00:04:30.857 --> 00:04:31.738
at Jinda Group.

00:04:31.857 --> 00:04:32.417
It was real.

00:04:32.938 --> 00:04:33.777
But I didn't faint.

00:04:39.097 --> 00:04:39.698
Mr. Shen.

00:04:40.018 --> 00:04:40.618
Sorry to have

00:04:40.777 --> 00:04:41.498
kept you waiting.

00:04:42.217 --> 00:04:43.258
Let's talk

00:04:43.337 --> 00:04:44.018
over lunch.

00:04:57.178 --> 00:04:58.977
The band-aid I gave you at the hospital

00:05:00.457 --> 00:05:01.897
was bought by Secretary Chen.

00:05:03.297 --> 00:05:05.337
I saw how moved you were,

00:05:05.738 --> 00:05:06.657
so I stayed silent.

00:05:11.258 --> 00:05:12.138
Also,

00:05:12.698 --> 00:05:14.097
when you applied for the job,

00:05:14.457 --> 00:05:15.217
I read your post

00:05:15.217 --> 00:05:16.857
during the interview. Remember?

00:05:17.618 --> 00:05:18.457
You wrote,

00:05:19.457 --> 00:05:21.018
"If Grandma has ever

00:05:21.018 --> 00:05:22.618
made osmanthus jam for you,

00:05:23.738 --> 00:05:26.537
you'll never feel lonely."

00:05:28.297 --> 00:05:29.578
Total nonsense.

00:05:30.097 --> 00:05:31.537
Melodramatic rambling.

00:05:43.417 --> 00:05:44.537
Didn't I tell you

00:05:44.578 --> 00:05:46.178
I learned ballet in school?

00:05:46.657 --> 00:05:47.657
I learned street dance.

00:05:47.977 --> 00:05:48.698
Popping.

00:05:48.897 --> 00:05:49.657
Breaking.

00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:51.178
Come on!

00:05:51.178 --> 00:05:52.258
Listen to me.

00:05:52.938 --> 00:05:54.217
Every outfit you chose for me

00:05:54.217 --> 00:05:55.777
disappointed me.

00:05:55.977 --> 00:05:57.378
The colors, quality,

00:05:57.537 --> 00:05:58.217
and taste

00:05:58.297 --> 00:05:59.297
were all terrible.

00:05:59.618 --> 00:06:01.138
Reflect on yourself.

00:06:01.258 --> 00:06:02.217
Look inward.

00:06:02.217 --> 00:06:03.138
Is it because

00:06:03.138 --> 00:06:04.657
you're outdated and stuffy

00:06:04.738 --> 00:06:06.058
with taste behind the times?

00:06:07.297 --> 00:06:08.258
Your slicked-back hair

00:06:08.457 --> 00:06:09.258
never changes.

00:06:10.058 --> 00:06:10.777
And your suit

00:06:11.457 --> 00:06:12.457
is always the same.

00:06:12.818 --> 00:06:13.337
What's wrong?

00:06:13.417 --> 00:06:14.417
Are you bed linens?

00:06:14.417 --> 00:06:15.337
And those glasses.

00:06:15.378 --> 00:06:16.178
Are you nearsighted?

00:06:16.297 --> 00:06:17.417
Why do you wear them?

00:06:17.417 --> 00:06:17.977
What for?

00:06:18.018 --> 00:06:19.138
To act like old money?

00:06:25.217 --> 00:06:26.178
I'm better than you.

00:06:27.018 --> 00:06:29.657
You claim to be a food expert

00:06:30.058 --> 00:06:31.297
and host Family Feast.

00:06:32.097 --> 00:06:33.537
None of the food

00:06:34.657 --> 00:06:36.738
you cook tastes good.

00:06:36.777 --> 00:06:37.738
It's awful.

00:06:37.818 --> 00:06:39.457
I force myself to eat it, okay?

00:06:39.537 --> 00:06:40.738
The jewelry pieces you gave me

00:06:41.698 --> 00:06:42.938
are tacky and tasteless.

00:06:43.698 --> 00:06:44.977
Not a single one I like.

00:06:46.288 --> 00:06:47.472
Forced myself to accept them.

00:06:49.018 --> 00:06:49.578
Fine.

00:06:50.178 --> 00:06:51.018
I'll tell

00:06:51.537 --> 00:06:52.698
Secretary Chen.

00:06:53.417 --> 00:06:54.698
I didn't buy them, anyway.

00:06:55.337 --> 00:06:56.657
I didn't even check them.

00:07:01.258 --> 00:07:02.138
Doesn't matter.

00:07:02.897 --> 00:07:04.337
It doesn't matter.

00:07:04.777 --> 00:07:05.818
Men's gifts are

00:07:05.818 --> 00:07:06.618
all the same.

00:07:06.738 --> 00:07:07.698
I'm used to it.

00:07:08.578 --> 00:07:09.258
Used to it?

00:07:10.498 --> 00:07:11.417
How many guys

00:07:11.897 --> 00:07:12.618
have you dated?

00:07:12.618 --> 00:07:13.616
How many did I tell you?

00:07:14.618 --> 00:07:15.777
You said I was the only one.

00:07:15.857 --> 00:07:16.297
Yeah.

00:07:16.618 --> 00:07:17.378
Just one.

00:07:17.698 --> 00:07:18.698
Plus a zero.

00:07:35.457 --> 00:07:36.496
Three days later, the 8th,

00:07:36.857 --> 00:07:38.378
meet me at the Bureau at 10 AM.

00:07:50.777 --> 00:07:52.857
Yuanhang is a major investment firm.

00:07:53.217 --> 00:07:54.457
We're just a start-up.

00:07:54.818 --> 00:07:56.618
Why would Jiang Liang invest in us?

00:07:56.698 --> 00:07:58.297
Investing in successful start-ups

00:07:58.297 --> 00:07:59.378
is just bandwagoning.

00:07:59.417 --> 00:08:00.618
Investing now shows

00:08:01.217 --> 00:08:02.178
vision.

00:08:02.337 --> 00:08:04.138
- Vision.
- Vision.

00:08:05.498 --> 00:08:05.938
Alright.

00:08:06.297 --> 00:08:07.618
We have an investor.

00:08:07.698 --> 00:08:08.977
Our video got 10k likes.

00:08:09.018 --> 00:08:09.698
We're doing well.

00:08:10.058 --> 00:08:11.698
Let's hope everything picks up.

00:08:11.777 --> 00:08:12.457
Fingers crossed.

00:08:12.857 --> 00:08:13.857
Only good news ahead.

00:08:14.258 --> 00:08:14.897
So

00:08:15.337 --> 00:08:16.657
let's drink till we drop.

00:08:17.977 --> 00:08:18.698
Till we drop.

00:08:18.777 --> 00:08:19.657
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:08:19.897 --> 00:08:21.258
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:08:37.378 --> 00:08:38.657
I heard your Chinese grades

00:08:38.657 --> 00:08:39.577
dropped recently.

00:08:40.098 --> 00:08:41.697
Do you need a tutor?

00:08:42.738 --> 00:08:44.697
No tutor beats sis-in-law.

00:08:45.858 --> 00:08:47.458
She's so patient

00:08:47.697 --> 00:08:49.577
and explains things clearly.

00:08:50.577 --> 00:08:52.297
I get it right away.

00:08:55.138 --> 00:08:55.618
Haoming,

00:08:55.697 --> 00:08:57.057
when are you bringing her back?

00:08:58.738 --> 00:08:59.937
She's still busy with work

00:09:00.697 --> 00:09:01.738
and won't return soon.

00:09:03.537 --> 00:09:05.458
You clearly miss her.

00:09:05.577 --> 00:09:06.697
Just beg for forgiveness.

00:09:06.697 --> 00:09:08.218
I don't miss her.

00:09:10.498 --> 00:09:11.897
Say one thing and mean another.

00:09:12.458 --> 00:09:13.738
That's the idiom for you.

00:09:15.258 --> 00:09:17.138
She's definitely still angry.

00:09:17.618 --> 00:09:18.577
Did you apologize

00:09:18.577 --> 00:09:19.817
sincerely to her?

00:09:21.777 --> 00:09:23.378
Seems you've mastered Chinese.

00:09:24.138 --> 00:09:25.738
Idioms flow naturally now.

00:09:27.937 --> 00:09:29.057
Wait a minute.

00:09:30.177 --> 00:09:30.657
Sit.

00:09:32.458 --> 00:09:33.417
Sit down.

00:09:39.218 --> 00:09:39.978
First,

00:09:40.057 --> 00:09:41.657
sis-in-law taught me that idiom.

00:09:42.057 --> 00:09:43.777
Second, you should know this.

00:09:44.378 --> 00:09:45.738
When guys get rejected,

00:09:45.738 --> 00:09:47.057
it's okay.

00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:49.057
Even if you're rejected 100 times,

00:09:49.098 --> 00:09:50.378
you must win her back

00:09:50.378 --> 00:09:50.978
in the end.

00:09:51.338 --> 00:09:51.978
Got it?

00:09:54.777 --> 00:09:55.618
If only

00:09:55.618 --> 00:09:56.657
you could study with

00:09:56.697 --> 00:09:57.577
such perseverance.

00:09:58.417 --> 00:09:59.697
Mind your own business.

00:09:59.937 --> 00:10:00.378
Okay?

00:10:00.577 --> 00:10:01.218
Okay.

00:10:01.817 --> 00:10:02.738
My performance is

00:10:02.738 --> 00:10:03.978
none of your business, either.

00:10:13.218 --> 00:10:14.618
Close the door on your way out.

00:10:26.138 --> 00:10:27.657
(When guys get rejected,)

00:10:27.657 --> 00:10:28.657
(it's okay.)

00:10:29.057 --> 00:10:30.738
Even if you're rejected 100 times,

00:10:31.218 --> 00:10:32.897
you must win her back

00:10:32.897 --> 00:10:33.458
in the end.

00:10:46.338 --> 00:10:47.537
What's up?

00:10:49.177 --> 00:10:50.297
Are you there?

00:10:53.297 --> 00:10:54.057
(Shen Haoming)
Going to bed?

00:11:00.794 --> 00:11:01.657
(Xu Yan)

00:11:01.657 --> 00:11:02.218
(Not yet.)

00:11:02.577 --> 00:11:03.138
(What's up?)

00:11:06.138 --> 00:11:07.858
(Shen Haoming)
(Mr. Baraikin and I)

00:11:07.858 --> 00:11:09.258
(spoke on the phone.)

00:11:09.537 --> 00:11:12.018
(He'll visit Jinda in a few days.)

00:11:15.577 --> 00:11:16.858
(If you're free,)

00:11:17.057 --> 00:11:18.657
(let's have dinner together.)

00:11:20.458 --> 00:11:21.138
(I can't.)

00:11:21.458 --> 00:11:22.378
(I've been swamped.)

00:11:22.657 --> 00:11:23.537
(Give him my regards.)

00:11:27.657 --> 00:11:28.177
(Shen Haoming)
(Alright.)

00:11:29.258 --> 00:11:30.577
(I'll have Chen)

00:11:30.618 --> 00:11:32.018
(wire you the money.)

00:11:36.978 --> 00:11:37.458
(Xu Yan)
(Thanks.)

00:11:41.537 --> 00:11:42.537
How do I win her back?

00:11:43.098 --> 00:11:44.378
Should I keep arguing with her?

00:11:44.657 --> 00:11:45.858
I'm such an idiot.

00:11:58.657 --> 00:11:59.098
Again.

00:11:59.498 --> 00:12:01.218
You're the sparring partner applicant?

00:12:05.897 --> 00:12:06.897
With your physique,

00:12:06.978 --> 00:12:07.858
can you handle it?

00:12:08.297 --> 00:12:09.057
No problem.

00:12:09.417 --> 00:12:10.657
In our line of work,

00:12:11.297 --> 00:12:12.498
we must endure hits.

00:12:13.138 --> 00:12:13.897
Not everyone

00:12:13.897 --> 00:12:14.817
can withstand this.

00:12:15.537 --> 00:12:16.018
Sir.

00:12:16.338 --> 00:12:18.098
I want to learn how to take hits.

00:12:18.618 --> 00:12:19.098
Fine.

00:12:19.697 --> 00:12:20.618
Let's give it a try.

00:12:21.297 --> 00:12:22.738
When do we start?

00:12:25.297 --> 00:12:25.937
Right now.

00:12:26.297 --> 00:12:27.138
Headshot first.

00:12:27.817 --> 00:12:28.618
Pardon?

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:32.048
(Treatise on Superfluous Things)

00:12:32.048 --> 00:12:33.178
While...

00:12:40.138 --> 00:12:40.738
Grandma, look.

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:41.657
See?

00:12:41.697 --> 00:12:43.218
Nice office, right?

00:12:43.777 --> 00:12:44.858
Let me show you around.

00:12:45.018 --> 00:12:45.498
See?

00:12:46.297 --> 00:12:47.018
This is

00:12:47.177 --> 00:12:48.817
our main lobby.

00:12:49.018 --> 00:12:50.018
- The second floor.
- So spacious.

00:12:51.057 --> 00:12:52.297
Display wall.

00:12:52.378 --> 00:12:53.098
See?

00:12:53.417 --> 00:12:54.258
And we have...

00:12:54.537 --> 00:12:55.297
Look who this is.

00:12:55.297 --> 00:12:56.218
Grandma.

00:12:56.618 --> 00:12:57.098
Look.

00:12:57.218 --> 00:12:58.096
You like our office?

00:12:59.618 --> 00:13:01.098
Yan, Lin,

00:13:01.577 --> 00:13:02.378
you girls really

00:13:02.498 --> 00:13:04.138
picked a great place.

00:13:04.297 --> 00:13:05.858
Spacious and bright.

00:13:06.098 --> 00:13:06.978
I'm here.

00:13:07.338 --> 00:13:08.018
Is it Grandma?

00:13:09.297 --> 00:13:09.897
Hi, Grandma.

00:13:09.978 --> 00:13:10.458
Grandma.

00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:12.378
This is our designer

00:13:12.537 --> 00:13:14.138
I keep telling you about.

00:13:14.138 --> 00:13:14.897
Yao.

00:13:15.057 --> 00:13:16.897
Here's our long-legged model,

00:13:16.897 --> 00:13:17.657
Guan.

00:13:17.657 --> 00:13:18.177
Look.

00:13:18.417 --> 00:13:19.577
- Hi Grandma.
- See her legs?

00:13:21.458 --> 00:13:22.738
Yan, Lin,

00:13:23.057 --> 00:13:25.177
and your partners,

00:13:26.218 --> 00:13:28.098
Yao, Guan, right?

00:13:28.338 --> 00:13:28.858
You girls

00:13:29.018 --> 00:13:29.897
are very talented

00:13:29.897 --> 00:13:31.417
young ladies.

00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:34.338
I'm so happy

00:13:34.378 --> 00:13:35.858
to see you working together.

00:13:36.657 --> 00:13:38.618
I wish you a grand opening

00:13:39.216 --> 00:13:40.098
and booming business.

00:13:40.138 --> 00:13:42.098
- Thanks, Grandma.
- Thanks, Grandma.

00:13:42.098 --> 00:13:43.458
Grandma's the best.

00:13:43.978 --> 00:13:44.498
Alright then.

00:13:44.537 --> 00:13:46.018
I won't keep you any longer.

00:13:46.177 --> 00:13:47.057
You're busy girls.

00:13:47.777 --> 00:13:48.297
Okay.

00:13:48.338 --> 00:13:49.018
Bye, Grandma.

00:13:49.057 --> 00:13:49.937
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

00:13:49.978 --> 00:13:50.537
I have to go.

00:13:51.138 --> 00:13:51.897
Go ahead.

00:13:52.297 --> 00:13:53.098
Bye, Grandma.

00:13:53.498 --> 00:13:54.057
Miss you.

00:13:56.937 --> 00:13:58.258
Why are you hanging up?

00:13:58.258 --> 00:13:59.177
Talk to me more.

00:14:00.297 --> 00:14:02.738
I just want to tell you.

00:14:03.937 --> 00:14:04.577
Life is not

00:14:05.338 --> 00:14:07.177
all about making money.

00:14:08.378 --> 00:14:10.697
You need inherent confidence.

00:14:11.177 --> 00:14:12.738
I hope you can

00:14:12.858 --> 00:14:14.417
maintain good spirits

00:14:15.018 --> 00:14:18.378
while working hard.

00:14:18.937 --> 00:14:19.738
Okay, Grandma.

00:14:20.817 --> 00:14:21.258
Yan.

00:14:21.258 --> 00:14:22.177
Remember that...

00:14:22.338 --> 00:14:22.858
Yan.

00:14:22.858 --> 00:14:23.897
Take your medicine.

00:14:23.978 --> 00:14:24.777
Ms. Xu.

00:14:24.777 --> 00:14:25.458
I have to go.

00:14:26.458 --> 00:14:26.897
What's up?

00:14:26.897 --> 00:14:28.297
This is my office?

00:14:28.897 --> 00:14:29.417
Yeah.

Yan.

00:14:31.258 --> 00:14:33.138
My design studio is so spacious.

00:14:33.138 --> 00:14:33.817
Is it enough?

00:14:34.018 --> 00:14:36.138
More than enough.

00:14:37.378 --> 00:14:37.937
Alright.

00:14:38.937 --> 00:14:39.417
Alright.

00:14:39.978 --> 00:14:40.738
From now on,

00:14:40.858 --> 00:14:42.218
this will be our starting point.

00:14:42.378 --> 00:14:43.218
Let's go big.

00:14:43.338 --> 00:14:44.138
Let's go big.

00:14:44.297 --> 00:14:45.098
Let's tidy up.

00:14:45.098 --> 00:14:45.618

Bring two more boxes.

Slowly.

00:15:21.057 --> 00:15:21.777
Careful.

00:15:37.258 --> 00:15:37.978
Mr. Shen.

00:15:38.657 --> 00:15:39.577
The design has been

00:15:39.618 --> 00:15:40.177
revised.

00:15:40.697 --> 00:15:42.338
The design team wants to meet.

00:15:42.897 --> 00:15:44.138
I checked your schedule.

00:15:44.498 --> 00:15:44.978

00:15:47.817 --> 00:15:48.458
this month.

00:15:50.697 --> 00:15:52.458
The Legal Department added three clauses

00:15:53.018 --> 00:15:54.018
to the contract annex

00:15:54.018 --> 00:15:54.897
as requested.

00:15:55.498 --> 00:15:56.018
Also,

00:15:56.138 --> 00:15:57.978
they modified clauses

00:15:57.978 --> 00:15:58.777
No. 3 and No. 8.

00:15:59.297 --> 00:15:59.897
I've booked

00:16:00.297 --> 00:16:01.738

Mr. Shen.

00:16:08.777 --> 00:16:09.777
Is something wrong?

00:16:11.458 --> 00:16:12.138
From now on,

00:16:13.258 --> 00:16:15.098
I don't want to hear the number "eight".

00:16:28.338 --> 00:16:28.897
Mr. Shen.

00:16:29.138 --> 00:16:30.417
Land acquisition evaluation

00:16:30.458 --> 00:16:31.338
and market research

00:16:31.378 --> 00:16:32.417
on Project 018

00:16:32.417 --> 00:16:33.258
have been completed.

00:16:33.537 --> 00:16:34.978
Most land acquisitions

00:16:34.978 --> 00:16:35.978
are feasible.

00:16:36.378 --> 00:16:38.378
Except that

00:16:38.417 --> 00:16:39.297
a 120-mu plot

00:16:39.297 --> 00:16:40.577
in the core zone

00:16:40.817 --> 00:16:42.258
has been purchased.

00:16:42.897 --> 00:16:44.338
It was acquired

00:16:44.577 --> 00:16:45.498
ten years ago.

00:16:47.537 --> 00:16:48.338
Ten years ago?

00:16:48.738 --> 00:16:50.338
It was a remote wasteland back then

00:16:50.978 --> 00:16:51.978
without any

00:16:52.258 --> 00:16:53.057
development plans.

00:16:54.618 --> 00:16:55.738
Who'd buy land there?

00:16:56.138 --> 00:16:57.897
Mr. Shen Haoming.

00:17:02.177 --> 00:17:02.577
Dad.

00:17:03.498 --> 00:17:04.337
You want to see me?

00:17:05.258 --> 00:17:07.018
You bought the 120-mu land

00:17:07.097 --> 00:17:08.337
of Project 018 a decade ago?

00:17:08.738 --> 00:17:09.418
Why?

00:17:12.297 --> 00:17:13.218
The government

00:17:14.018 --> 00:17:15.938
wanted to establish
a new free trade zone.

00:17:16.857 --> 00:17:17.577
The group

00:17:18.057 --> 00:17:19.337
conducted evaluations

00:17:19.898 --> 00:17:21.617
and prioritized development

00:17:21.658 --> 00:17:23.978
in the eastern and southern areas.

00:17:24.658 --> 00:17:25.178
First,

00:17:25.938 --> 00:17:27.218
they wanted to be close

00:17:27.777 --> 00:17:28.458
to downtown.

00:17:29.218 --> 00:17:29.817
Second,

00:17:30.337 --> 00:17:32.218
the eastern and southern peripherals

00:17:32.337 --> 00:17:34.537
had a relatively complete infrastructure

00:17:34.658 --> 00:17:35.458
for residential use.

00:17:35.817 --> 00:17:37.178
Everyone thought

00:17:37.857 --> 00:17:39.978
the northern area was barren land

00:17:40.418 --> 00:17:41.857
with no development value.

00:17:42.178 --> 00:17:42.698
Indeed.

00:17:42.817 --> 00:17:44.498
That's what the executives thought.

00:17:46.258 --> 00:17:46.857
But

00:17:47.577 --> 00:17:48.097
people

00:17:48.097 --> 00:17:49.698
overlooked one critical factor.

00:17:51.577 --> 00:17:52.297
High-speed rail.

00:17:55.297 --> 00:17:56.617
The rail network plan

00:17:57.377 --> 00:17:58.418
announced that year

00:17:59.258 --> 00:18:00.938
showed that the high-speed rail

00:18:01.498 --> 00:18:03.617
would connect major economic zones

00:18:04.297 --> 00:18:05.738
and reduce intercity distances.

00:18:06.698 --> 00:18:08.418
I studied the published blueprint.

00:18:09.258 --> 00:18:10.738
The rail extended to the north,

00:18:11.577 --> 00:18:13.377
intersecting with our free trade zone's

00:18:13.898 --> 00:18:15.337
intercity light rail system.

00:18:16.337 --> 00:18:18.498
A city's subway planning

00:18:18.898 --> 00:18:20.097
must coordinate with

00:18:20.137 --> 00:18:21.337
major transportation hubs.

00:18:22.178 --> 00:18:22.898
So, I predicted

00:18:23.537 --> 00:18:25.137
that the municipal government would

00:18:25.137 --> 00:18:26.617
leverage the transportation hub

00:18:27.057 --> 00:18:29.258
and establish a New District.

00:18:30.097 --> 00:18:31.258
So, I believed this land

00:18:31.337 --> 00:18:32.418
was worth investing in.

00:18:33.377 --> 00:18:34.258
That means

00:18:35.218 --> 00:18:37.018
you demonstrated remarkable foresight

00:18:37.297 --> 00:18:38.258
back then.

00:18:39.698 --> 00:18:40.978
I must thank you

00:18:41.018 --> 00:18:42.377
for sending me to the top schools

00:18:43.458 --> 00:18:44.537
where I learned

00:18:44.698 --> 00:18:46.137
diverse urban designs

00:18:46.258 --> 00:18:46.978
and planning.

00:18:48.218 --> 00:18:49.178
But I have a question.

00:18:50.537 --> 00:18:51.498
You wanted to

00:18:51.537 --> 00:18:52.617
acquire the project.

00:18:53.057 --> 00:18:53.938
You'd need money.

00:18:54.178 --> 00:18:55.577
Where did your funding come from?

00:18:57.057 --> 00:18:58.577
From my college classmates.

00:19:00.137 --> 00:19:01.297
They had

00:19:01.698 --> 00:19:02.777
considerable idle funds

00:19:03.337 --> 00:19:04.617
but lacked knowledge

00:19:04.738 --> 00:19:06.658
of profitable investment channels.

00:19:07.698 --> 00:19:08.857
I managed

00:19:09.097 --> 00:19:10.337
some short-term futures

00:19:10.498 --> 00:19:11.817
through the years,

00:19:12.018 --> 00:19:13.297
earning them good returns

00:19:13.617 --> 00:19:15.297
as well as their trust.

00:19:15.857 --> 00:19:16.537
I see.

00:19:18.577 --> 00:19:19.658
One more question.

00:19:21.137 --> 00:19:21.857
Since you've been

00:19:22.018 --> 00:19:24.218
operating this project for so long.

00:19:24.337 --> 00:19:25.698
What would you ask for

00:19:26.498 --> 00:19:27.418
to hand it over

00:19:27.537 --> 00:19:28.458
to our company?

00:19:28.577 --> 00:19:29.137
Feel free

00:19:29.337 --> 00:19:30.297
to make any requests.

00:19:30.577 --> 00:19:31.097
Alright?

00:19:34.738 --> 00:19:36.018
I'll transfer this land

00:19:36.978 --> 00:19:37.777
to the group

00:19:38.577 --> 00:19:40.258
to meet all corporate needs

00:19:40.738 --> 00:19:42.137
without any conditions.

00:19:46.418 --> 00:19:46.938
Why?

00:19:49.537 --> 00:19:49.978
Dad.

00:19:51.938 --> 00:19:53.817
I've been thinking about

00:19:55.577 --> 00:19:57.018
what happened with Haochen.

00:19:58.337 --> 00:19:59.498
It seems I've never

00:19:59.658 --> 00:20:00.537
properly apologized

00:20:00.698 --> 00:20:01.537
to you or Mom

00:20:02.097 --> 00:20:03.178
about this.

00:20:09.137 --> 00:20:10.418
Regarding this matter,

00:20:12.377 --> 00:20:13.178
your mom and I

00:20:13.178 --> 00:20:14.218
don't need apologies.

00:20:15.377 --> 00:20:16.777
We just want you to understand

00:20:18.097 --> 00:20:19.057
that everyone

00:20:19.057 --> 00:20:19.898
must take

00:20:20.297 --> 00:20:21.938
full responsibility for their actions.

00:20:23.577 --> 00:20:24.178
I understand.

00:20:25.938 --> 00:20:27.258
That's also my philosophy.

00:20:29.137 --> 00:20:30.018
But I've always

00:20:30.218 --> 00:20:31.297
hoped that you could

00:20:31.377 --> 00:20:32.297
understand me.

00:20:33.258 --> 00:20:35.258
But I never considered your feelings.

00:20:36.097 --> 00:20:37.898
I don't regret
what happened with Haochen.

00:20:39.418 --> 00:20:40.498
But I know it has

00:20:40.537 --> 00:20:41.777
caused you and Mom

00:20:41.777 --> 00:20:42.698
tremendous stress.

00:20:43.738 --> 00:20:44.817
This is my fault.

00:20:46.218 --> 00:20:47.938
I had a bad temper before.

00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:49.617
I acted tough

00:20:51.258 --> 00:20:52.857
because I was insecure

00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:54.097
and anxious.

00:20:54.738 --> 00:20:56.698
I didn't know what would happen.

00:20:59.978 --> 00:21:01.617
Eventually, I saw that you and Mom

00:21:02.777 --> 00:21:04.057
accepted Haochen,

00:21:05.777 --> 00:21:07.178
giving him a carefree

00:21:07.577 --> 00:21:08.617
living environment.

00:21:10.297 --> 00:21:11.617
Your tolerance

00:21:11.898 --> 00:21:13.537
truly empowered me.

00:21:18.777 --> 00:21:19.698
We've quarreled

00:21:21.938 --> 00:21:22.777
and fought

00:21:24.137 --> 00:21:24.898
quite enough.

00:21:27.777 --> 00:21:29.097
After I calmed down,

00:21:31.777 --> 00:21:32.777
I did realize

00:21:32.817 --> 00:21:33.857
why you doubted me

00:21:34.258 --> 00:21:35.057
both then

00:21:36.418 --> 00:21:37.817
and right now.

00:21:39.938 --> 00:21:40.817
I must

00:21:41.817 --> 00:21:43.057
take the responsibility.

00:21:45.577 --> 00:21:46.418
That's why

00:21:46.577 --> 00:21:47.537
I never intended

00:21:47.617 --> 00:21:48.857
to negotiate terms with you.

00:21:51.978 --> 00:21:53.018
You came back

00:21:54.577 --> 00:21:55.537
from the resort

00:21:55.577 --> 00:21:56.777
as a different person.

00:21:59.817 --> 00:22:01.218
(If you love someone,)

00:22:02.377 --> 00:22:03.498
you should trust them

00:22:04.218 --> 00:22:05.337
and believe their actions

00:22:05.337 --> 00:22:06.377
are meant to protect you.

00:22:07.018 --> 00:22:08.698
No matter how old we grow,

00:22:10.218 --> 00:22:11.337
in our elders' eyes,

00:22:11.537 --> 00:22:12.938
we'll always remain children.

00:22:13.777 --> 00:22:15.857
But their distrust doesn't equate

00:22:16.458 --> 00:22:18.377
to indifference or neglect.

00:22:21.658 --> 00:22:23.297
I'll send the land transfer agreement

00:22:23.738 --> 00:22:24.617
to the group.

00:22:28.018 --> 00:22:29.057
Listen, Haoming.

00:22:29.698 --> 00:22:30.698
If you can

00:22:30.938 --> 00:22:32.018
facilitate

00:22:32.137 --> 00:22:33.817
official collaboration with Baraikin

00:22:33.938 --> 00:22:34.938
and expand

00:22:34.938 --> 00:22:36.097
our overseas market,

00:22:36.377 --> 00:22:37.698
then I promise that

00:22:38.577 --> 00:22:40.178
I'll bring you onto the board.

00:22:41.658 --> 00:22:42.817
But remember this.

00:22:44.018 --> 00:22:45.337
Once you're in this game,

00:22:45.898 --> 00:22:47.297
you'll face doubts

00:22:47.377 --> 00:22:48.258
and even scrutiny

00:22:48.418 --> 00:22:49.297
from more people.

00:22:49.738 --> 00:22:50.617
Besides, I won't

00:22:50.978 --> 00:22:52.978
allow you to make any mistakes.

00:22:54.898 --> 00:22:55.377
Dad.

00:22:56.537 --> 00:22:57.297
I don't mind that.

00:22:58.297 --> 00:22:59.898
I just hope you can

00:23:00.617 --> 00:23:01.537
start trusting me.

00:23:02.658 --> 00:23:03.418
I also hope

00:23:04.218 --> 00:23:05.817
I can start trusting you.

00:23:07.617 --> 00:23:08.297
Come on, son.

00:23:08.817 --> 00:23:09.817
Walk with me.

00:23:17.018 --> 00:23:18.608
(Yan Studio)

00:23:24.898 --> 00:23:25.297
Sit.

00:23:25.898 --> 00:23:26.377
Hello.

00:23:26.458 --> 00:23:27.817
My name is Meng Zhao.

00:23:27.898 --> 00:23:29.738
I graduated from
Jingzhou Business University.

00:23:30.137 --> 00:23:31.097
I'm Zhao Kehuan

00:23:31.097 --> 00:23:32.738
from Jingzhou Communication University,

00:23:32.738 --> 00:23:33.898
majoring in Broadcasting.

00:23:34.018 --> 00:23:34.898
I'm Qu Xiaowan,

00:23:35.057 --> 00:23:36.178
24 years old.

00:23:36.337 --> 00:23:38.057
I worked at a 4A agency.

00:23:38.137 --> 00:23:39.258
I was a planner

00:23:39.258 --> 00:23:40.337
of Family Feast.

00:23:40.817 --> 00:23:42.178
What are you applying for?

00:23:42.498 --> 00:23:43.898
Promotion Specialist.

00:23:44.057 --> 00:23:44.912
Business Specialist.

00:23:45.018 --> 00:23:45.777
Anything will do.

00:23:45.857 --> 00:23:47.458
I'll do whatever you assign me.

00:23:47.617 --> 00:23:48.137
Rest assured.

00:23:48.218 --> 00:23:49.498
I'm highly action-oriented.

00:23:49.617 --> 00:23:50.377
I will complete

00:23:50.458 --> 00:23:51.498
any tasks given to me.

00:23:51.698 --> 00:23:52.498
She's like you.

00:23:53.057 --> 00:23:53.938
I'm not so direct.

00:23:54.817 --> 00:23:55.978
What's your expected salary?

00:23:56.178 --> 00:23:58.137
Depends on the workload.

00:23:58.498 --> 00:23:59.577
At my previous company,

00:23:59.698 --> 00:24:01.218
my salary was higher because

00:24:01.377 --> 00:24:02.337
I did a triple workload.

00:24:02.577 --> 00:24:03.857
I'll accept a normal salary

00:24:04.137 --> 00:24:05.018
for a normal workload.

00:24:05.178 --> 00:24:05.857
Don't worry.

00:24:06.458 --> 00:24:08.057
We'll hire more business specialists

00:24:08.337 --> 00:24:09.057
if needed.

00:24:09.498 --> 00:24:10.258
It would be great

00:24:10.337 --> 00:24:12.857
if the salary could be
a bit higher than my previous job.

00:24:13.258 --> 00:24:14.297
Otherwise, I can accept

00:24:14.297 --> 00:24:15.178
the same salary.

00:24:15.337 --> 00:24:16.218
I'm still young.

00:24:16.337 --> 00:24:18.218
Money isn't that important to me.

00:24:18.377 --> 00:24:19.418
Opportunity matters more.

00:24:20.137 --> 00:24:20.698
Thank you.

00:24:21.418 --> 00:24:21.898
Thank you.

00:24:26.418 --> 00:24:27.658
Welcome to Yan Studio.

00:24:29.057 --> 00:24:30.097
Thanks for joining us.

00:24:30.418 --> 00:24:30.938
Yan.

00:24:31.097 --> 00:24:32.178
I'll go wherever you are.

00:24:32.617 --> 00:24:33.218
I promise

00:24:33.258 --> 00:24:34.097
I'll work hard.

Welcome to Yan Studio.

Do you like

00:24:49.817 --> 00:24:50.777
the environment here?

00:24:51.097 --> 00:24:51.738
It's amazing.

00:24:53.218 --> 00:24:53.857
Your first video

00:24:53.857 --> 00:24:54.777
has done so well.

00:24:54.857 --> 00:24:56.218
When will you post the second one?

00:24:57.137 --> 00:24:58.018

Let's get in.

The staff are ready

00:24:59.018 --> 00:24:59.738
to brief you.

00:24:59.938 --> 00:25:00.817
- Alright.
- This way.

(Shen Haoming)

00:26:26.738 --> 00:26:27.137
Hello.

00:26:28.337 --> 00:26:28.817
Hello.

00:26:29.698 --> 00:26:30.258
What's wrong?

00:26:31.738 --> 00:26:33.178
Nothing. Just a reminder.

00:26:35.218 --> 00:26:36.337
Tomorrow's the 8th.

00:26:38.137 --> 00:26:39.297
See you at the Bureau

00:26:39.377 --> 00:26:40.018
at 10 AM.

00:26:41.137 --> 00:26:41.938
Bad timing.

00:26:42.498 --> 00:26:44.137
I'm on a business trip in Russia.

00:26:45.297 --> 00:26:46.537
You went to Russia?

00:26:47.617 --> 00:26:48.297
You know,

00:26:48.337 --> 00:26:50.097
things are going well with Mr. Baraikin.

00:26:50.617 --> 00:26:51.458
So I have to strike

00:26:51.898 --> 00:26:53.258
when the iron's hot.

00:26:56.577 --> 00:26:58.018
But didn't we agree to meet

00:26:59.178 --> 00:27:00.537
at the Bureau on the 8th?

00:27:02.418 --> 00:27:03.498
Next month, maybe.

00:27:04.218 --> 00:27:06.018
Then the application will expire.

00:27:08.178 --> 00:27:08.817
What can I do?

00:27:09.337 --> 00:27:10.018
I'm busy.

00:27:11.777 --> 00:27:13.218
I'm traveling to France,

00:27:13.297 --> 00:27:13.938
England,

00:27:14.057 --> 00:27:14.978
and so on.

00:27:15.738 --> 00:27:16.577
I can't go back.

00:27:17.898 --> 00:27:18.777
Shen Haoming.

00:27:18.938 --> 00:27:19.617
Do you have to

00:27:19.617 --> 00:27:20.738
go on a business trip now?

00:27:21.377 --> 00:27:23.377
Mr. Baraikin approached me.

00:27:23.698 --> 00:27:24.777
I can't tell him,

00:27:24.817 --> 00:27:26.018
"Let me get divorced first",

00:27:26.097 --> 00:27:26.537
can I?

00:27:27.018 --> 00:27:27.817
Come here.

00:27:28.218 --> 00:27:29.178
Mr. Baraikin needs me.

00:27:29.258 --> 00:27:29.898
I have to go.

00:27:29.938 --> 00:27:30.537
Coming.

00:27:30.777 --> 00:27:31.577
Okay, bye.

00:27:52.938 --> 00:27:54.018
Xin, stop running.

00:27:54.258 --> 00:27:55.137
You can't go in.

00:27:55.297 --> 00:27:56.218
You can't go in there.

00:27:56.258 --> 00:27:56.658
Be good.

00:28:03.258 --> 00:28:05.218
It's not a good angle.

00:28:11.178 --> 00:28:12.458
She'll believe it, right?

00:28:14.898 --> 00:28:15.817
I need more photos.

Hello? Yan.

00:29:34.218 --> 00:29:35.418
Is Shen Haoming in Jingzhou?

00:29:37.178 --> 00:29:38.297
Mr. Shen is in Moscow.

00:29:42.738 --> 00:29:44.178
Got it. Thanks.

00:29:51.898 --> 00:29:52.617
Did Xu Yan

00:29:52.817 --> 00:29:53.738
call you today?

00:29:53.898 --> 00:29:55.097
Just as you predicted.

00:29:55.458 --> 00:29:56.537
She called several times.

00:29:56.738 --> 00:29:57.218
Good.

00:29:57.938 --> 00:29:58.258
Okay.

00:29:58.377 --> 00:29:59.738
I won't be at the office.

00:29:59.898 --> 00:30:01.258
Call me if anything comes up.

00:30:24.418 --> 00:30:25.377
It's an illusion.

00:30:26.698 --> 00:30:27.498
It must be.

00:30:38.898 --> 00:30:39.498
Illusion.

00:30:51.297 --> 00:30:52.577
Aren't you in Russia?

00:30:54.698 --> 00:30:56.777
Which city is Shen Haoming in now?

00:30:57.938 --> 00:30:59.137
He's in Moscow.

00:31:00.377 --> 00:31:01.577
But he told me

00:31:01.577 --> 00:31:02.817
he's in Alexandria.

00:31:04.577 --> 00:31:05.698
Yeah, he's in Alexandria.

00:31:06.097 --> 00:31:06.978
My mistake, Yan.

00:31:07.377 --> 00:31:08.978
Mr. Shen is in Alexandria.

00:31:12.097 --> 00:31:13.938
But you just said he was in Russia.

00:31:15.178 --> 00:31:15.738
Yeah.

00:31:15.817 --> 00:31:17.218
Alexandria in Russia.

00:31:17.938 --> 00:31:19.658
Alexandria is in Egypt.

(Paid Promotion)

00:31:25.698 --> 00:31:27.458
Doesn't Russia have a city
named Alexandria?

00:31:31.057 --> 00:31:32.738
I changed my schedule last minute.

00:31:34.978 --> 00:31:36.178
Thanks for cooperating.

00:31:38.537 --> 00:31:39.297
The Bureau, now.

00:31:39.898 --> 00:31:41.218
I changed my plans

00:31:41.218 --> 00:31:42.337
due to health issues.

00:31:42.337 --> 00:31:43.418
I'm seeing a doctor.

00:31:43.537 --> 00:31:44.137
What's wrong?

00:31:50.738 --> 00:31:51.418
Heart problems.

00:31:52.698 --> 00:31:53.392
Chest tightness.

00:31:53.978 --> 00:31:54.577
Heartache.

00:31:54.898 --> 00:31:55.537
Palpitations.

00:31:56.458 --> 00:31:57.018
Discomfort.

00:31:57.297 --> 00:31:58.537
I can't breathe.

00:32:01.458 --> 00:32:01.898
Alright.

00:32:02.258 --> 00:32:03.137
I'll go with you.

00:32:04.698 --> 00:32:05.097
Hurry up.

00:32:09.418 --> 00:32:10.178
Mr. Shen,

00:32:11.577 --> 00:32:12.938
your heart is perfectly fine.

00:32:13.137 --> 00:32:14.178
No issues whatsoever.

00:32:15.137 --> 00:32:15.698
Really?

00:32:16.137 --> 00:32:18.498
Then why do I feel chest tightness

00:32:18.537 --> 00:32:19.617
and palpitations?

00:32:19.938 --> 00:32:21.698
That's from the guilt.

00:32:23.218 --> 00:32:24.658
The possible causes

00:32:24.777 --> 00:32:25.658
could be numerous,

00:32:26.018 --> 00:32:26.577
but

00:32:26.738 --> 00:32:27.777
it's definitely not

00:32:27.898 --> 00:32:30.137
caused by cardiac issues.

00:32:31.218 --> 00:32:32.658
It's more related

00:32:32.898 --> 00:32:33.658
to work stress

00:32:33.898 --> 00:32:35.617
and emotional fluctuations.

00:32:37.857 --> 00:32:38.577
Have you

00:32:38.658 --> 00:32:40.258
been anxious

00:32:40.698 --> 00:32:42.337
about anything lately?

00:32:43.178 --> 00:32:43.777
Doctor,

00:32:44.577 --> 00:32:46.097
I don't think he's anxious

00:32:46.097 --> 00:32:46.898
about anything.

00:32:46.938 --> 00:32:48.018
But he's been

00:32:48.258 --> 00:32:49.698
tired and exhausted

00:32:49.872 --> 00:32:51.888
since he's been flying to
many countries every day.

00:32:52.418 --> 00:32:53.498
I mean, walking to...

00:32:53.537 --> 00:32:54.018
Right?

00:32:54.458 --> 00:32:56.097
Walking to many countries every day.

00:32:56.498 --> 00:32:57.057
So tiring.

00:32:58.978 --> 00:32:59.698
Mr. Shen,

00:33:00.218 --> 00:33:02.018
you must rest
despite your heavy schedule.

00:33:02.337 --> 00:33:03.617
I'll prescribe some nourishing

00:33:03.658 --> 00:33:04.537
and calming

00:33:04.698 --> 00:33:05.458
medications.

00:33:05.537 --> 00:33:06.057
Listen.

00:33:06.377 --> 00:33:07.537
Since we can't

00:33:07.577 --> 00:33:08.498
find the cause here,

00:33:08.817 --> 00:33:10.337
maybe I should get

00:33:10.698 --> 00:33:12.218
a comprehensive checkup.

00:33:14.057 --> 00:33:15.218
That's a good idea.

00:33:16.458 --> 00:33:17.658
We can rule out

00:33:17.658 --> 00:33:18.498
other possibilities.

00:33:18.817 --> 00:33:19.898
You and your wife

00:33:20.418 --> 00:33:21.537
will be more reassured.

00:33:21.898 --> 00:33:22.258
Okay.

00:33:23.137 --> 00:33:23.617
I will

00:33:23.817 --> 00:33:25.498
schedule you for an MRI first.

00:33:26.097 --> 00:33:26.617
No,

00:33:27.018 --> 00:33:28.057
I think I need

00:33:28.658 --> 00:33:30.097
comprehensive tests,

00:33:30.777 --> 00:33:32.617
beginning with ENT

00:33:33.698 --> 00:33:34.898
and ophthalmology.

00:33:35.938 --> 00:33:36.458
Alright.

00:33:48.097 --> 00:33:48.817

00:35:13.537 --> 00:35:14.617
Are you done?

00:35:17.257 --> 00:35:18.137
Stop rushing me.

00:35:18.217 --> 00:35:18.858
Almost done.

00:35:20.137 --> 00:35:21.737
Can you hurry up?

00:35:22.057 --> 00:35:22.898
They'll close soon.

(Men's Restroom)

00:35:24.737 --> 00:35:26.097
What's the rush?

00:35:27.137 --> 00:35:28.097
These matters

00:35:28.778 --> 00:35:30.137
can't be rushed.

00:35:30.818 --> 00:35:32.097
I'm waiting for the urge.

00:35:32.097 --> 00:35:32.657
You've been

00:35:33.298 --> 00:35:34.177
waiting for the urge

00:35:34.177 --> 00:35:35.097
for over half an hour.

00:35:35.697 --> 00:35:36.858
It's 4:55 PM now.

00:35:36.898 --> 00:35:37.898
They close at 5:30 PM.

00:35:37.938 --> 00:35:39.057
We'll be late.

00:35:40.978 --> 00:35:41.737
Now I feel it.

00:35:42.818 --> 00:35:43.537
Now?

00:35:43.778 --> 00:35:44.257
Hold it in.

00:35:45.257 --> 00:35:46.257
Pee after the divorce.

(Service Suspended)

00:35:50.338 --> 00:35:50.778
Hurry.

00:35:51.177 --> 00:35:51.818
Excuse me.

00:35:52.137 --> 00:35:52.737
Sorry.

00:35:53.057 --> 00:35:53.537
Uh.

00:35:54.057 --> 00:35:54.657
Hurry.

00:35:55.137 --> 00:35:56.097
(Civil Affairs Bureau)
We're getting a divorce.

00:35:56.577 --> 00:35:57.657
Check the time.

00:35:57.697 --> 00:35:58.657
It's 5:35 PM.

00:35:58.818 --> 00:35:59.898
The system's shut down.

00:35:59.938 --> 00:36:00.778
Come back tomorrow.

00:36:04.057 --> 00:36:05.057
We're really sorry.

00:36:05.177 --> 00:36:06.818
Can you make an exception

00:36:06.978 --> 00:36:07.898
and do it for us?

00:36:08.458 --> 00:36:10.257
Did you complete the cooling-off period?

00:36:10.577 --> 00:36:11.137
Yes.

00:36:13.257 --> 00:36:14.217
It's been thirty days.

00:36:16.378 --> 00:36:17.458
So are you still getting

00:36:17.577 --> 00:36:18.338
divorced?

00:36:19.177 --> 00:36:19.697
Yes.

00:36:21.378 --> 00:36:21.778
Okay.

00:36:22.018 --> 00:36:23.338
Submit the application

00:36:23.378 --> 00:36:24.177
again today.

00:36:24.537 --> 00:36:25.697
Come back on the 8th

00:36:26.018 --> 00:36:27.458
next month before 5:30 PM.

00:36:32.737 --> 00:36:33.177
Wait.

00:36:33.978 --> 00:36:35.898
Another cooling-off period?

00:36:36.217 --> 00:36:37.617
You missed the deadline.

00:36:37.818 --> 00:36:39.338
Your previous divorce application

00:36:39.378 --> 00:36:40.818
was automatically voided.

00:36:40.898 --> 00:36:42.298
You'll have to redo it.

00:36:42.697 --> 00:36:43.378
Remember.

00:36:43.418 --> 00:36:44.458
Be punctual next time.

00:36:44.537 --> 00:36:45.338
Otherwise,

00:36:45.338 --> 00:36:46.577
you'll come a third time.

00:36:56.498 --> 00:36:57.458
Glaring won't help.

00:36:58.097 --> 00:36:59.338
I didn't make the rules.

00:37:14.298 --> 00:37:16.217
8th next month.
First thing in the morning.

00:37:26.097 --> 00:37:26.697
Ma'am.

00:37:27.177 --> 00:37:28.097
You can clock out now.

00:37:29.177 --> 00:37:29.617
Thank you.

(Audio & Film Equipment Museum)

00:37:43.057 --> 00:37:44.657
You talk business here, Mr. Liang?

00:37:45.458 --> 00:37:46.458
My work style

00:37:46.458 --> 00:37:47.177
is unique.

00:37:47.378 --> 00:37:48.577
My business partners should

00:37:48.577 --> 00:37:49.458
get used to it.

00:37:51.617 --> 00:37:52.177
Let's go.

00:37:57.658 --> 00:38:00.624
(Audio & Film Equipment Museum)

00:38:02.778 --> 00:38:04.378
This is a private museum

00:38:05.018 --> 00:38:05.778
run by my friend.

00:38:07.577 --> 00:38:08.778
I'm their

00:38:09.057 --> 00:38:10.418
VVVVIP guest.

00:38:11.818 --> 00:38:13.378
Whenever I need some time alone,

00:38:13.378 --> 00:38:14.378
this is where I come.

00:38:15.097 --> 00:38:16.338
It's open for me 24/7.

00:38:16.898 --> 00:38:17.697
No disturbances.

00:38:21.537 --> 00:38:22.217
I can tell

00:38:22.217 --> 00:38:23.458
you love films.

00:38:29.418 --> 00:38:30.338
When I was young,

00:38:31.057 --> 00:38:32.137
my dad was busy working.

00:38:33.338 --> 00:38:34.418
My sister studied abroad.

00:38:36.537 --> 00:38:37.697
Only my mom was there

00:38:38.657 --> 00:38:39.697
during my childhood.

00:38:42.378 --> 00:38:43.378
She loved movies.

00:38:44.097 --> 00:38:45.338
She took me to a movie

00:38:45.338 --> 00:38:46.177
almost every day.

00:38:47.898 --> 00:38:49.577
Those two magical hours

00:38:51.617 --> 00:38:52.338
were her gift

00:38:52.338 --> 00:38:53.257
of happiness.

00:38:57.778 --> 00:38:59.137
I wanted to study filming

00:39:03.378 --> 00:39:04.257
in college.

00:39:05.577 --> 00:39:06.498
But I had to

00:39:06.657 --> 00:39:07.697
study finance as my dad

00:39:07.697 --> 00:39:08.298
requested.

00:39:11.577 --> 00:39:12.418
Then

00:39:14.697 --> 00:39:15.537
my parents passed.

00:39:16.617 --> 00:39:17.657
My sister was busy.

00:39:20.217 --> 00:39:21.338
I went to the movies alone.

00:39:27.257 --> 00:39:28.458
So this is a collection

00:39:28.458 --> 00:39:29.617
of your regrets.

00:39:35.057 --> 00:39:35.938
As a director,

00:39:36.498 --> 00:39:37.938
I missed my leading lady.

00:39:39.298 --> 00:39:40.217
But as a businessman,

00:39:41.737 --> 00:39:42.418
I found you.

00:39:43.858 --> 00:39:45.498
My one-in-a-lifetime

00:39:47.577 --> 00:39:48.137
partner.

00:39:48.978 --> 00:39:50.338
I didn't have the privilege

00:39:50.737 --> 00:39:52.458
to watch movies as a kid.

00:39:54.298 --> 00:39:55.737
But I loved TV shows

00:39:57.257 --> 00:39:58.657
and news anchors.

00:40:00.137 --> 00:40:01.298
So I wondered

00:40:02.778 --> 00:40:03.858
whether I could

00:40:05.338 --> 00:40:06.458
become like them.

00:40:08.177 --> 00:40:08.697
See,

00:40:09.458 --> 00:40:10.217
we have a lot

00:40:10.257 --> 00:40:11.018
in common.

00:40:11.978 --> 00:40:12.498
Right?

00:40:18.737 --> 00:40:19.858
This...

00:40:21.057 --> 00:40:22.057
looks like...

00:40:22.298 --> 00:40:24.057
The same as the one in Roman Holiday.

00:40:24.298 --> 00:40:24.978
Exactly.

00:40:25.298 --> 00:40:26.418
I've watched that movie.

00:40:32.217 --> 00:40:33.057
Can I take a photo?

00:40:33.537 --> 00:40:34.097
Let me do it.

00:40:34.298 --> 00:40:35.097
Thanks, I got this.

00:40:58.778 --> 00:41:00.097
I don't like the ending.

00:41:01.498 --> 00:41:02.617
One day to love.

00:41:03.137 --> 00:41:04.298
A lifetime to forget.

00:41:05.018 --> 00:41:05.498
How tragic.

00:41:06.057 --> 00:41:07.018
What a tragedy.

00:41:09.177 --> 00:41:10.938
All the kids would think

00:41:10.938 --> 00:41:12.057
that a princess

00:41:12.418 --> 00:41:13.978
should break through all obstacles

00:41:14.057 --> 00:41:15.537
and be with her true love.

00:41:16.737 --> 00:41:17.257
Only adults

00:41:17.257 --> 00:41:18.537
realize that people

00:41:19.617 --> 00:41:21.018
from different backgrounds

00:41:21.137 --> 00:41:22.657
have different responsibilities

00:41:22.818 --> 00:41:23.537
and problems.

00:41:24.858 --> 00:41:25.537
A loving couple

00:41:25.537 --> 00:41:26.858
may not end up together.

00:41:28.378 --> 00:41:29.378
Roman Holiday

00:41:31.338 --> 00:41:32.458
wasn't really a fairy tale.

00:41:34.378 --> 00:41:35.217
I remember

00:41:35.257 --> 00:41:36.137
there was a line.

00:41:39.577 --> 00:41:40.816
"Lift up your head, princess.

00:41:41.298 --> 00:41:42.577
If not, the crown falls."

00:41:44.217 --> 00:41:45.378
I share this line with you.

00:41:46.697 --> 00:41:47.298
But I prefer

00:41:47.298 --> 00:41:48.498
another line.

00:41:50.617 --> 00:41:51.818
"Life isn't always

00:41:51.818 --> 00:41:53.057
what one likes."

00:42:19.217 --> 00:42:19.737
Hey, pretty.

00:42:20.697 --> 00:42:21.537
Want to be the first

00:42:21.537 --> 00:42:22.458
to ride shotgun?

00:42:23.458 --> 00:42:23.978
Hop on.

00:42:25.697 --> 00:42:26.378
Mr. Liang.

00:42:31.697 --> 00:42:33.057
Meiru. What a coincidence.

00:42:34.257 --> 00:42:35.338
She is...?

00:42:37.137 --> 00:42:37.537
Hello.

00:42:39.137 --> 00:42:39.978
I'm Xu Yan,

00:42:40.657 --> 00:42:41.840
Mr. Liang's business partner.

00:42:43.577 --> 00:42:44.298
This is...

00:42:44.338 --> 00:42:45.097
I'm Meiru.

00:42:45.498 --> 00:42:46.577
I work in self-media.

00:42:51.617 --> 00:42:52.217
Mr. Liang,

00:42:52.657 --> 00:42:54.137
you tricked me into hopping on,

00:42:54.177 --> 00:42:54.737
but this bike

00:42:54.737 --> 00:42:55.778
couldn't even start.

00:42:56.298 --> 00:42:57.537
Why are you riding it again?

00:43:02.858 --> 00:43:04.057
I guess I'm not

00:43:04.057 --> 00:43:05.018
your first passenger.

00:43:09.057 --> 00:43:09.938
Give me a second.

00:43:12.378 --> 00:43:13.137
Come here.

00:43:13.217 --> 00:43:13.617
Come on.

00:43:13.818 --> 00:43:14.537
Come on.

00:43:16.577 --> 00:43:17.257
Why are you here?

00:43:17.737 --> 00:43:18.418
You lectured me

00:43:18.458 --> 00:43:19.577
on film history.

00:43:19.778 --> 00:43:20.938
It was really enlightening.

00:43:21.338 --> 00:43:22.458
So I'm planning

00:43:22.458 --> 00:43:23.537
a movie salon event.

00:43:23.898 --> 00:43:24.938
Will you tell me more?

00:43:27.018 --> 00:43:28.097
Did you sign up for

00:43:28.097 --> 00:43:29.217
that art program

00:43:29.338 --> 00:43:29.978
I suggested?

00:43:32.018 --> 00:43:32.498
You didn't.

00:43:33.458 --> 00:43:34.657
That program

00:43:34.697 --> 00:43:36.137
will do you good.

00:43:36.657 --> 00:43:37.657
Complete the course,

00:43:37.778 --> 00:43:39.097
and we'll discuss art.

00:43:39.257 --> 00:43:39.737
Alright?

00:43:42.298 --> 00:43:43.498
Remember to call me then.

00:43:45.057 --> 00:43:45.537
Go ahead.

00:43:49.898 --> 00:43:50.617
There you are.

00:43:53.858 --> 00:43:54.737
Don't get me wrong.

00:43:54.737 --> 00:43:55.697
She was just

00:43:55.697 --> 00:43:56.617
an art enthusiast.

00:43:57.097 --> 00:43:58.177
I get it, Mr. Liang.

00:43:59.177 --> 00:44:00.617
You're just helping girls

00:44:00.657 --> 00:44:01.978
improve themselves

00:44:02.057 --> 00:44:03.217
as their mentor.

00:44:03.697 --> 00:44:04.418
Right?

00:44:05.737 --> 00:44:06.938
I genuinely want to

00:44:07.217 --> 00:44:08.657
show care and support

00:44:09.057 --> 00:44:10.537
to the girls I meet.

00:44:12.498 --> 00:44:13.418
Well done.

00:44:14.177 --> 00:44:15.298
I have many other

00:44:15.338 --> 00:44:16.057
good qualities.

00:44:16.057 --> 00:44:17.298
You should get to know me.

00:44:17.418 --> 00:44:18.338
Like our outfits.

00:44:18.617 --> 00:44:20.257
Don't you see our outfits
match perfectly?

00:44:20.657 --> 00:44:22.137
Aren't we in sync?

00:44:28.602 --> 00:44:30.800
(Xu Yan)

00:44:50.498 --> 00:44:51.338
Haoming.

00:44:52.298 --> 00:44:52.938
What a surprise.

00:44:58.778 --> 00:44:59.818
You know what?

00:45:00.657 --> 00:45:01.697
Rumors have been

00:45:02.137 --> 00:45:03.657
spreading in our circle.

00:45:05.097 --> 00:45:05.978
Xu Yan

00:45:06.418 --> 00:45:07.378
and Jiang Liang

00:45:07.898 --> 00:45:09.177
are really hitting it off.

00:45:11.858 --> 00:45:12.498
You're drunk.

00:45:20.217 --> 00:45:21.818
Don't you know Jiang Liang?

00:45:23.137 --> 00:45:24.858
He's a ladies' man

00:45:25.338 --> 00:45:26.818
who never commits to anyone.

00:45:27.617 --> 00:45:29.137
Even he fell for Xu Yan

00:45:29.137 --> 00:45:30.577
and got completely infatuated.

00:45:32.057 --> 00:45:33.938
Xu Yan is quite something.

00:45:37.898 --> 00:45:39.097
Or perhaps

00:45:40.498 --> 00:45:42.298
she's desperate to find her next target.

00:45:45.298 --> 00:45:46.537
Xu Yan is my wife.

00:45:47.257 --> 00:45:48.097
Watch your mouth.

00:45:49.338 --> 00:45:50.378
Still defending her.

00:45:51.338 --> 00:45:52.298
She's just using you

00:45:52.298 --> 00:45:53.137
as a rich fool.

00:45:53.137 --> 00:45:54.137
And you still defend her.

00:45:54.898 --> 00:45:55.537
Shen Haoming.

00:45:55.737 --> 00:45:57.018
You should really check

00:45:57.137 --> 00:45:57.737
whether she's

00:45:57.737 --> 00:45:58.657
cheated on you.

00:45:58.898 --> 00:45:59.617
Or maybe

00:45:59.617 --> 00:46:00.537
you're used to it.

00:46:06.057 --> 00:46:07.617
I'm the only one loyal to you.

00:46:10.018 --> 00:46:11.057
But you won't even

00:46:11.097 --> 00:46:12.018
look my way, will you?

00:46:18.978 --> 00:46:20.057
You're such a coward.

00:46:31.378 --> 00:46:32.577
You're finally looking at me.

00:46:33.778 --> 00:46:34.617
Hit me then.

00:46:34.778 --> 00:46:35.697
Why don't you hit me?

00:46:35.737 --> 00:46:36.418
Go ahead.
