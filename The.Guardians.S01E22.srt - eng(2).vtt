00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.980
Uncle Gu.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.100
You still read poetry?

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.540
I...

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.780
I just got fond of these two lines.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.040
[Some work of noble note, may yet be done.
Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.]

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.340
Such a fine pen.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.340
What's this for?

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.220
I found it in an antique shop in London.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.020
The owner told me

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.900
it once belonged to a fallen viscount.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.460
Uncle Gu, with your military exploits,

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.780
you are certainly greater than
that viscount.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.290
You deserve it.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.340
What a fine pen.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.020
The word was originally his name,

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.900
[Devotion]
but I had it erased

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.780
and replaced with this word.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.580
To be honest,

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.780
the craftsman's skill was poor.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.170
"Devotion Shines Through the Ages".

How many people

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.540
could truly be worthy of this?

[Devotion]

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.810

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.700
Mr. Shen.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:30.780

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.460
I'm looking for Mr. Shen.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.770
He isn't here right now.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.650
He didn't come to work?

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:36.980
He came,
but said he left something at home,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.940
and went back to Sanyangli to get it.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:40.730
Thanks.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.700
Take care on your way.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:53.700
Wait a moment.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:00.850
Director Lee.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:02.730
Director Liang.

Heading out?

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.850
Where's Charlie? Still not with you?

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.220
Charlie is sick.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:13.060
Why? Did you need him for something?

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.180
You just came back
and are leaving again?

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.220
With this kind of work attitude,

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.180
won't it look bad
to others in the institute?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.700
Right now the first priority here

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.580
is breaking the Xige Code.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.850
Even Mr. Shen's Encryption Section

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.610
has been reassigned to help.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.460
Only my R&D Section

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.220
has become like a useless chess piece.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.300
So do you think

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.820
there's any point for me to stay here?

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.850
Should I just sit in my office
doing nothing every day?

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:39.460
Director Liang.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.700
Let me speak frankly.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.060
Rather than wasting my time here,

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.340
I'd rather use it

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.490
to spend with my wife.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.980
Even if it's just walking
or having coffee,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.460
I find that far more meaningful.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.490
Whether it's idle time

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.610
or being the center of attention,

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:56.980
discipline is discipline.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.850
As long as you
take the new government's salary,

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.060
even if your seat has nails in it,

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.220
you should sit properly during work.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:05.940
Tell me,

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:08.850
are you speaking
on behalf of the Colonel

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.100
or is this your own opinion?

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:14.610
It's not important.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.460
Amu, escort Director Lee back.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:00.460

Director Lee said he couldn't find

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.220
what you wanted at the office.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.490
Maybe you can check at home again?

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.220
I understand.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.300

Mr. Shen,

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.610
I do have something to ask you.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.580
If you don't want to be cut into pieces

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.890
and thrown into a garbage bag,

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:42.820
then tell me the truth.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.300
Who sent you here?

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.340
You know the man who sent me.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.340
His name is Gu Fuhua.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:55.820
Gu Fuhua?

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.610
Is he from Shanghai BIS?

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.820
Or from Sasaki's MSS?

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.300
He's a Nationalist army officer.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.490
You don't know him?

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.220
But unfortunately, Mr. Shen,

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.530
you will never meet him.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.060
Because he's dead.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.580
He died at the hands of the Japanese.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.820
But the fountain pen I gave him

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.580
is on your desk.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.700
And the word "Devotion"

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.340
is engraved on it.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.340
I gave that to him back then.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.180
So who exactly are you?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.580

I have something
very important to tell you.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.340
I also have urgent business to handle.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.610
I heard the Imperial Army
is heading south to Nanyang.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.460

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:50.850
and sell my stocks.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.340
If I don't, it'll be too late.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.580
So you are with the BIS.

Have you broken the Xige Code?

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.340
You must tell me everything.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.820
Otherwise, you will die.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.420
Mr. Shen.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.100
I don't know whose side

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.220
those people outside are on.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.100

It's a much younger Miss Susu.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.340
I believe she's also surnamed Shen.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.940
Farmer sent this photo to us

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.220
until we confirmed it was safe.

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:29.740
He asked me to give it to you.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:35.500
Being able to see Susu once more
is enough for me.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.780
Thank you, Comrade Ruan Qing.

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:18.780
The Organization originally
assigned me to assist you

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.060
to continue completing the covert plan

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.300
of replacing
the puppet army's military code.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.220
But now Liang Jingyuan
has set his eyes on you,

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.780
and the KMT-CCP relations
are rapidly changing.

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.980
It's no longer safe to remain
in the Cryptography Institute.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.130
The Organization has already arranged
an evacuation plan.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.130
We will return to Yan'an together.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.060
I'm afraid my time is running out.

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:45.300
Is it your illness?

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:47.780
Comrade Bai Ye,

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:49.740
we've already arranged a doctor.

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:57.300
It's cancer.
It has already spread to my lungs.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.020
It's incurable.

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:00.940
The reason I hid this

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.130
is because

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:04.020
once the Japanese learned of my illness,

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.060
they'd never have allowed me
to come to Shanghai,

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:08.540
and I would never have had the chance

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.540
to continue executing the covert plan.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:11.500
I didn't expect

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.850
that once I came,
Comrade Hei would sacrifice his life.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:24.740
This next mission will depend on you.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.460
What mission?

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:31.780
Comrade Bai Ye.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.740
Using the data brought by Yi Xiuyuan,

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.540
I've decrypted their Xige Code.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.300
And now I discovered that Chiang,
while speaking of resisting Japan,

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.300
is secretly planning to attack Huangqiao

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.740
to wipe out our New Fourth Army.

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:58.740
This top-secret level code

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.780
has been entirely used against us.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.020
Han Deqin fears the Eighth Route
and New Fourth Army joining forces,

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:09.250
so he has already formulated

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:10.970
a plan to fight south first, then north.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.730
They intend to first annihilate our

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.490
New Fourth Army in northern Jiangsu,

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:16.410
and then move

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:18.410
to deal with
our southbound Eighth Route Army.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:20.500
Ms. Xian.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.020
What is it?

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:24.290
The market will close in 15 minutes.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.260
Will you follow or sell your stocks?

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.050
You must decide quickly.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.500
Help me sell them.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.900
Alright, we'll act immediately.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.420
Hurry.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:41.740
Faster.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.260
The New Fourth Army's
northern Jiangsu unit

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.740
is isolated
in the southeast at Huangqiao.

00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:59.260
With only seven thousand troops,

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.530
they're unable to resist
Han Deqin's 40,000 troops.

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.260
And the Eighth Route Army to the north

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.260
and the Fourth and Fifth Detachments
of the New Fourth Army to the west

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.500
are all seven days' march
from Huangqiao.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.700
Plus the puppet army's obstruction,

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.020
it's hard for them
to support each other.

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:14.980
Although Han Deqin is temporarily
delayed by heavy rain,

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.420
I estimate the battle will begin
as early as tomorrow night.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.700
The anti-Japanese tide of fighters
from eight provinces

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.500
must not be stopped here.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.020
Exactly.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.900
That's why we
cannot waste even a minute.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.020
The reason I risked trying to
meet you earlier

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.420
was because the matter was urgent.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.700
If I couldn't see you today,

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.810
my only choice would be to risk
sending a transmission

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:37.500
to contact the Organization.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.460
No matter what,

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.420
this intelligence

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.530
must be sent back before dawn tomorrow.

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.420
Give me the information.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.530
I'll deliver it to
the Organization immediately.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.980
Earlier,
I couldn't confirm your identity.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.660
So to be safe, I didn't carry it on me.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.500
Once back at Sanyangli,

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.700
I'll immediately give you their detailed

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.980
military strategic deployment map.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.260
Alright, let's return to
Sanyangli immediately.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:02.740
I'll take the front door.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:04.500
You take the back door.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:05.810
Six o'clock.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.740
I'll come to your place
pretending to bring a food box.

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:09.260
Okay.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.810
Someone's been shot!

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:25.090
Run!

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:13.530
Shen Wanqing is Bai Ye.

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:17.810
He cracked the Xige Code.

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:24.330
The Nationalists want

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:26.530
to suppress the New Fourth Army.

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.530
I know.

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:31.090
Don't speak, don't speak.

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.850
Get a car, quick!

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:38.570
Six o'clock.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.570
Sanyangli.

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:43.850
He will

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:45.850
risk sending a message.

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.330
Stop him.

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:51.900
The signal truck

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.220
will locate him quickly.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.370
He won't finish sending it.

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:59.370
Help him get the intelligence out.

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:01.180
Go help him.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.180
Quick.

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:17.610
Biyun.

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:21.290
Biyun!

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:23.330
Biyun!

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:25.530
Biyun!

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:40.090
Mr. Lee, don't worry.

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:41.610
We will do our best to save Mrs. Lee.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.740
Who fired the shot?

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:00.570
The shooter moved quickly.

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:03.130
From my angle at the time,

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:04.850
I couldn't see his face clearly.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.740
Did you see who she was meeting?

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:11.810
There were too many people in the hall.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.660
I lost her as soon as I entered.

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:18.260
When I saw her again,

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.570
she had already been shot.

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:25.900
Turns out you're not
as smart as I thought.

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:32.330
Liang Jingyuan.

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:34.740
I've told you long ago,

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.850
there was no need
to stage this self-injury act.

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:39.610
If you think Xian Biyun
is a Communist spy,

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:41.740
you could just arrest her directly.

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:44.260
If you can't lure out the spy,

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.850
and your father
still can't break Xige Code,

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:47.850
then next week,

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:50.610
you'll both return to Chongqing.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:51.370
You know perfectly well

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:53.420
we can never go back to Chongqing.

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:55.260
To come to Shanghai,

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.570
I've already been on
the BIS's assassination list.

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:58.610
I've staked

00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:59.900
my entire life on this trip.

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:07.330
This is

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.290
your last chance.

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:54.820
Director Lee.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.380
It's so late. What are you doing?

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:00.340
Director Lee.

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:06.420
I'll be brief.

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.530
Ms. Xian has been shot.

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:08.530
She's now in the hospital.

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:10.090
I'm here on her behalf to meet you.

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:11.300
Where's the intelligence?
Give it to me quickly.

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:13.650
Director Lee.

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:14.780
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:18.500
Your eyes...

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:20.500
Comrade Bai Ye.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.340
I know your contact code
with the Organization.

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:23.500
Susu.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.460
Nice act.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:40.860
Too bad.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.420
My contact code has never been "Susu".

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.130
You're in such a hurry.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:52.020
Two in a row rushing at me.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.940
I know why you're here.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.250
Too bad,
I don't have time to play with you.

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:33.380
Report.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.820
We've found a new radio signal.

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.380
Someone is transmitting.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:40.820
Keep close watch.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:41.340
Yes, sir.

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:45.050
Judging by the signal strength,

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:48.170
I think the radio source
should be in Sanyangli.

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:50.820
Keep monitoring.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:51.820
Yes, sir.

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:42.020
Why are you tied up here by him?

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.130
Mr. Shen.

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:49.250
Mr. Shen.

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.130
Mr. Shen, wake up.

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:53.730
The Third War Zone is currently
in radio silence.

00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:56.050
All the Japanese in Shanghai are
searching for the transmission source.

00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:57.570
Their signal trucks

00:40:57.590 --> 00:40:59.340
will soon lock onto this area.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.020
The military police
will be here any moment.

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:02.500
Go quickly.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:26.730
What are you doing?

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.460
Shen Wanqing has cracked the Xige Code.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.500
You know how important
this code is to us.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.170
Once he hands over the decryption method

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:38.500
to any organization,

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:41.050
our front-line soldiers will be doomed.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:42.730
I can't let him live.

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:45.170
But Liang Jingyuan still knows nothing.

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:46.420
That means
he has absolutely no intention

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:47.980
of telling anyone the decryption method

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:48.980
for the Xige Code.

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:53.050
The quartz crystal's frequency
in the radio

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:55.340
is proof he's been contacting outsiders.

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:00.420
Gu Yangshan.

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:03.610
You're anti-Japanese.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:05.380
So is he.

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:08.380
But now you're actually holding a gun

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.860
at an anti-Japanese patriot.

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:11.210
I'm telling you,

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:12.860
if you kill him today,

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.860
I will immediately go to
Liang Jingyuan and report you.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.340
Then none of us will live.

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:23.420
Can you guarantee that
after he's captured by the Japanese,

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:24.690
he won't betray us?

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:25.780
Can you guarantee it?

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:27.610
Ding Yi.

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:30.050
You're an actor, you can perform.

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:32.730
But the battlefield is no stage play.

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:33.730
I can gamble.

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:35.530
I can gamble with my own life.

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:37.380
But I can't gamble with the lives

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.860
of all the soldiers at the front.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.500
And he just sent out a transmission.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.130
Their direction-finding truck
will locate this place.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.690
When that happens,
he won't survive anyway.

00:42:57.070 --> 00:42:57.690
What are you doing?

00:42:58.920 --> 00:42:59.530
What are you doing?
