[The Guardians]

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.920
[Episode 26]

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.770
You didn't rest.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.210
I was waiting for you.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.690
I need a drink.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.460
You once said

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.850
alcohol harms the brain

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.540
and isn't something
a cryptographer like you

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.220
should be touching.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.450
Come on.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.100
Have some noodles.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.170
I know

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.100
Plain Noodles are your favorite.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.170
Didn't know when you'd be back,

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.410
so I heated it up several times.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.170
Eat while it's hot.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.260
I really missed this taste.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.570
Back then,

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.290
we could still sit together and plan

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.010
how to deal with Takeda

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.940
or Liang Jingyuan.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.450
It's like in this world,

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.100
there's no enemy we can't beat.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.450
Ding Yi.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.850
You should run now.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.690
It's not that bad yet.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:26.850
I can tell

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.170
you held back

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.610
in that report.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.610
I'm sorry.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.170
I thought

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.450
if I wrote this letter myself,

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.170
at least,

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.130
it wouldn't put your life in danger.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.610
But...

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.170
Sasaki's real goal

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.170
was to use Yasui to wipe out
the Tonoji family.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.850
I only found out today

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.980
the content of
the letter doesn't matter.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.380
What matters is you.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.010
He wants to use you
to frame the Tonoji family,

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.340
claiming they're colluding
with Britain and America.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.820
That's why
he won't let you walk out alive.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.730
Now, the Pacification Committee

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.570
has already adopted

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.810
Hashimoto Taro's cipher.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.290
With the Japanese,

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.220
your credibility is completely gone.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.250
I never thought
that after all our fighting,

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.730
we'd still end up in their trap.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.220
Why is it

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.540
that we've ended up like this?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.170
I keep wondering,

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.850
if back then,

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.540
after I killed Takeda,

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.730
I had just left Shanghai straight away,

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.930
would none of this have happened?

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.850
Then you and I

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.700
could still be friends.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.930
Ding Yi.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.140
You'll always be my friend.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.810
Getting to this point today

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.660
is because...

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.220
I couldn't choose
where I came from.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.050
Even though before,

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.730
we walked part of the road together,

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.980
in the days ahead,
we'll go our separate ways.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.050
So this bond between us,

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.050
this friendship,

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.340
can only come after our positions.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.140
Since we've both made our choices,

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.660
let's just stay on our own paths

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.250
and keep moving forward.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:18.930
Eat your noodles.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.410
I never said

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.730
I liked eating Plain Noodles.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.220
Where are you going?

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.130
I'm going to the hospital.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:40.340
Don't move.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.770
I'm going to the hospital
to see my wife.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:46.890
I told you not to move.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.220
Let me go!

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.770
I said I'm going to the hospital
to see my wife!

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:51.890
You jerk.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.730
What is that supposed to mean?

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.420
Are you planning to kill me?

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.610
Do you even know who I am?

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.610
How dare you point a gun at me!

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:05.100
Get out of my way!

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.010
- Move! Move! Move!
- Mr. Lee.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.010
Move!

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.300
Mr. Lee.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.420
Mr. Lee.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.100
Is there something you need?

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.100
Who is it?

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.130
Mr. Lee is here to see you.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.300
Let him in.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.890
Joseph, what brings you here?

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:04.530
Biyun.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:15.820
What's going on?

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.770
Sasaki used the military purge

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.420
of British and American influence

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.010
to frame me for colluding with them.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:23.300
His real aim is to use me as a pawn

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.980
to wipe out the entire Tonoji family.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.010
I've been suspended, put under review,

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.420
and confined to Sanyangli.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.370
This morning,

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:32.420
if I hadn't made a huge scene with them,

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.530
I wouldn't have come to see you.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.300
I've confirmed through investigation

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.940
that the patient on the top floor
is Grand Duke Tonoji.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.060
He's been in a coma all this time.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.370
Seems Sasaki can't hold back any longer.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.180
But there's something even more urgent.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:50.530
The cipher we designed

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.530
for the Pacification Committee
has been scrapped

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.650
and now they've switched to

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:55.770
a cipher system designed
by someone named

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:56.580
Hashimoto Taro.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.890
The Pacification Operation
is about to kick off.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.010
But I've been suspended and confined.

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:03.220
There's nothing I can do right now.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:05.980
And we don't have time to crack

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.060
the new cipher.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.300
Our only option now

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.850
is to make a copy of the codebook.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.340
Have Wu tail Hashimoto Taro

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.100
and find a way to get the codebook.

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:25.250
After days of digging,

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.010
I found out the Pacification Committee

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:29.340
has only one codebook
for its secure radio.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.340
Hashimoto always carries it with him.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.580
No one else can get near it.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.380
[Shanghai Branch, Pacification Committee]
I can't enter.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.060
It'd blow my cover.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:47.420
Only you can track him.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.900
Find a way to get that codebook.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:52.300
The New Asia Hotel.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.090
Okay.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.040
[New Asia Hotel]

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:17.260
Excuse me, make way.

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:20.810
Heads up, heads up!

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:34.180
Gu Yangshan.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.450
I've figured out
Hashimoto's daily routine

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:37.420
and his travel routes.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:40.490
We can set something up

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:41.490
along his usual path.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.060
And the spot?

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.940
It's chosen and the car's ready too.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.140
Now all we need is a rainy day.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.940
Xiao, the photos of Hashimoto.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.260
That man's extremely cunning.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.060
Getting a clear shot of his face
wasn't easy.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.900
But these pictures

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.850
are enough to confirm who he is.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.610
Biyun was spot on with her prediction.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:14.450
Recently,

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.540
Sasaki's private station
has been broadcasting nonstop.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.660
Our teammates decoding their messages

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.490
are working day and night nonstop.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.780
Most of the messages have been cracked.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:27.380
See for yourself.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:30.060
This is today's transmission.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:35.570
Lock down top floor; Target the doctor.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:39.660
What?

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.330
This Sasaki wants to

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:44.420
kill the new doctor
sent by the Grand Duke.

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.940
He's more afraid than us
of the Grand Duke waking up.

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:50.090
But if the Grand Duke really dies,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.220
then Ding Yi will lose

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.770
the shield protecting him
against Sasaki.

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:59.650
So we can't let Sasaki succeed.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:00.850
I think

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.770
we can have Ding Yi
submit this telegram.

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:08.250
The fake foster father matter

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.370
has already made him suspicious
of Joseph Lee.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.940
With just one telegram,

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.850
it's hard to convince the Tonoji family.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:21.610
True.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:24.650
In that case,

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.980
we'll have Biyun craft a solid script

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.130
based on this telegram.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.850
As long as we play this scene out,

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.530
they'll eventually find out

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:35.980
Sasaki's true face.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.100
Oh, on the hook.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.650
Ding Yi being confined
for inspection now

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:55.890
is definitely no coincidence.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.650
Sasaki must know very well

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.940
that once the Grand Duke
wakes up after the surgery,

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.060
his easy days are over.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.300
But for Ding Yi,

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:07.820
the Grand Duke waking up

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:10.490
might bring even greater danger.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.490
He once thought

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.890
the Tonoji family was his shield.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.130
Now it's turned into

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.460
a landmine ready to blow at any moment.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.980
That's why we need to take

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:30.820
this landmine off

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:31.890
and toss it out.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:40.850
The medicine in this bottle

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:42.340
can make someone pass out briefly,

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.850
without causing other effects.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.250
Uncle Wu, be careful with the dosage.

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:49.130
Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:50.490
Biyun,

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.850
the reason we're doing this

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.730
is to prevent the surgery
from proceeding,

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.100
keep the Grand Duke
from waking up,

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.700
and make it look like
Dr. Edward is gone,

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.700
so Sasaki will call off
the assassination.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.300
Right?

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.060
Exactly.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.730
But there's one thing I don't get.

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:13.820
Why do we have to

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.370
frame Hashimoto for it?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.610
His ties with Sasaki

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:19.100
don't seem that close.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.220
The Code Officer post
in the Pacification Committee

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.700
is absolutely critical.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:27.940
Sasaki will definitely choose

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.820
someone he trusts completely.

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:33.730
Alright, I get it.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.530

Tonight, you must make sure

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.490
she runs into Hashimoto

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.490

Sir.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:19.700
This is the inspection report
for the top-level ward.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.490
Yes, thank you.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:23.250
The Duke's health
is top-level confidential.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:25.290
There has only ever been one copy
of his report.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.180
It's personally kept by Dr. Edward.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:29.010
Are you okay?

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.940
It's okay.

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:37.330
Once this drug enters the body,

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.010
it won't cause instant unconsciousness.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:42.050
It kicks in about four hours later.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:57.700
Take this to the nurses, please.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.570

Thanks.

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:42.250
This is the route
Hashimoto takes to work.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.460
I'll dig a water pit on the sidewalk.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.220
He'll have to step into it to pass.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.620
I've been watching the area.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:56.570
The high-voltage wires there are old.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.140
I cut one section in advance

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.770
and tied it
with a loose knot to hold it.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.220
As soon as Hashimoto steps in the pit,

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.620
I'll pull the rope and release it.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.570
The wire will drop into the water.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.220
It'll look like Hashimoto died
from an accident.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.940
Then we'll pose as relief workers.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.220
On the way to the hospital,

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.250
we'll have enough time
to copy the codebook.

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:52.730
No trace will be left behind.

is Xian Biyun's driver.

They're with the other side.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.980
Ding Yi turned long ago, didn't he?

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:09.570
Why did you hide it, Gu Yangshan?

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.860
You switched sides, right?

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:14.660

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.330
Breaking the Sword Thrust Operation free

It's not like you're unaware.

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:34.290
If Chongqing finds out

that our informant has switched sides,

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.700
they'll shut down the Operation.

to infiltrate the enemy's core.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.940
We must catch this culprit.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.620
I'll show him what real hell looks like.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:22.010
Yes.

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:45.770
Did you hear? Mr. Hashimoto has died.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:46.490
Who died?

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:47.050
Hashimoto.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:47.460
What?

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:48.700
Hashimoto is dead?

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:49.330
I knew it already.

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:52.980
Who did it? So bold.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.900
Turns out he was Colonel Sasaki's son.

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.220
That's insanely bold.

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.770
Does anyone else know about this?

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.460
It's all over town already.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.700
Exactly what I'm saying.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.050
They dared to kill the Colonel's son.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.730
That's like throwing your life away.

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:08.050
Seriously, that's pure suicide.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.220
Did anyone see your face?

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.660
Hashimoto Taro was Sasaki's son.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.490
They'll never let this go.

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:39.700
The city's about to go on lockdown.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.700
Grab your camera and get out now.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.010
Wait any longer and you won't escape.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.200
[Wanted]

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.160
[Wanted: 10,000 silver dollars reward]

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.480
[Wanted: 10,000 silver dollars reward]

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.940
With Sasaki's resolve,

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.570
in less than three days,

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:08.220
he'll trace it to Yuyin Pavilion.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.460
You need to get out now.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.940
Things have come this far,

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.220
and you're still not leaving?

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.220
Everyone in Sanyangli

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.730
knows we love watching opera.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:18.860
But I haven't gone there

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:19.770
for a long time.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.980
If Sasaki traces it to Yuyin Pavilion,

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.700
he'll definitely suspect you.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.180
So you have to leave.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.770
But I think

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:34.090
you're the one in greater danger now.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:37.700
Wu's identity

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.660
has already been exposed to Luo Han.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.460
If Luo Han gets caught,

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.570
selling out your identity

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:46.700
could be his bargaining chip
for survival.

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:48.810
Of course,

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:50.810
if Luo Han makes it back to Chongqing,

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:52.730
he'll definitely go to my superiors

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:54.050
and report who you really are.

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:57.090
So even if I don't lay a hand on you,

00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:00.620
my superiors will still go after you.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:03.380
That's why, Ding Yi,

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:04.980
letting you go

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.620
is actually for your own good.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.730
You really believe

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.330
Luo Han won't betray you?

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:12.700
Of course, I trust him.

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:15.730
I'm the very sword
in the Sword Thrust Operation.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:19.180
As long as I'm here, the mission stands.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:21.700
So leaving is not an option for me.

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:24.620
So this is just you wanting me gone.

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:27.090
Once I'm out of the way,

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:30.250
you'll turn to those people

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.490
and pin the whole thing on me,

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:34.220
saying I was the one
working with Luo Han

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.730
and you had no idea.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:38.250
Given the way things are between us,

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:40.250
do you really think

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.620
Sasaki would believe you're clean?

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:47.620
So last week,

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.010
that anonymous report

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:51.900
was already sitting on Sasaki's desk.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.290
From a Japanese perspective,

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.140
people see us

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:00.180
as having cut ties long ago.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:03.570
Let me give you some advice,

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.940
don't assume
your position is untouchable.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.460
Remember how Takeda's unit
fell overnight?

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.330
If one day Sasaki's unit also collapses,

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:13.940
will you have any way out?

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:19.900
And that Tonoji family badge you wear,

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.220
how much longer can you keep it on?

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.250
So you're dead set on getting rid of me.

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.140
Ding Yi,

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:34.290
for any clash during the mission...

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:35.980
This time, it's bloodshed.

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:37.810
Next time,

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.810
it won't be as simple as that.

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:49.180
Hurry, go.

00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:58.380
Let's just leave it to fate.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:31.210
Kids, I promised you,

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:33.300
once we arrive,
I'll take you both out to have fun.

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.530
Stop the car.

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:50.340
The Japanese?

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.980
The Japanese.

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:02.900
Get out of the car!

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:04.010
Out of the car.

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:05.900
Everyone, out!

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:07.530
Out of the car.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.340
Taikun,

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:14.900
we're all just law-abiding folks.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:20.380
Move it!

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:23.130
It's okay, it's okay.

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:33.420
Squat down!

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.300
Check them one by one.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:35.740
Yes.

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:31.130
Get out, now!

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:39.090
Over there.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:41.460
Where is it?

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:43.380
That way!

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:45.260
Hurry!

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:47.420
Don't run!

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:49.420
Move!

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:51.690
Go!

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:53.260
After him!

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:56.300
Hold it!

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.460
Say it.

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:11.980
Which one of them is working with you?

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.820
You outsider, screw...

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:04.650
Please,

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:05.900
don't kill them.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.300
They haven't done anything.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.900
It was me.

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:14.130
I did it.

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:16.340
If that's the case,

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.900
they're useless to us.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.490
Raise your guns.

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:30.130
Take aim.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:31.570
Fire.

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:08.650
Find out exactly who they are.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:09.610
Yes, yes, got it.

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.610
This one looks familiar.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.010
You sure?

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.860
Absolutely sure.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.010
Taikun, I think this one came with him.

00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.900
They came together.

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:19.900
You sure?

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.260
I see it clearly.

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.900
Colonel, this is the confirmed report.

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:49.090
Do you think

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.690
that every night
when the show starts here,

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:55.420
a hundred people come and go,

00:40:56.030 --> 00:41:02.570
making it like finding a needle
in a haystack?

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:10.980
Whether they live or die doesn't matter.

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:14.530
What matters is

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:18.300
the people on this list

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:21.170
killed Taro.

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:28.300
It must've been for the codebook he had.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.530
And the ones who knew he had it

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:33.740
[Charlie Gu, Joseph Lee]
could

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:34.650
only be from

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:36.780
the Intelligence Department
of the New Government.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.210
A list of everyone
who came to Yuyin Pavilion.

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:47.090
Your partner has to be on this list.

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:48.610
Right?

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:54.820
Vegetables with dipping sauce.

00:42:58.800 --> 00:42:59.780
Looks pretty good.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.210
Tastes great.

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:19.010
You made this sauce?

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:24.820
Your mom made it.

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:28.530
It came from Baimahu.
