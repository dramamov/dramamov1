00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.550
If that's what love is

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.560
how utterly defenseless

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.520
and foolish it is.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.480
- I'm so sorry.
- Wait...

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.030
Geez, you have nothing to apologize for.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.990
Getting into this room.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.000
I'm just reminded of the mistake I made.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.120
Whether it was right or wrong isn't for you to decide alone.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.150
This is why I asked you to come.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.640
I kissed you here.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.690
I'm sorry.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.060
But I'm happy.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.340
Huh?

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.250
Because I've always wanted to do that.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.940
Fumi.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.590
Aren't you happy?

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.670
I...

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.470
I've never thought about anything like that.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.920
I see.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.800
I thought that you...

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.510
had feelings for me, too.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.230
Well then...

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.760
I'm sorry

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.400
for all of this

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.660
I do like you.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.440
Of course I do.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.440
You're beautiful

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.680
talented, and you work so hard.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.680
You're one of a kind.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.170
There's no reason for me not to admire you.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.320
But that's exactly why.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.690
Kissing you like that...

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.820
it shouldn't have happened.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.730
I'm sorry.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.370
I'm dumped.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.030
I'm back.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.420
Kaishin.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.230
Mom said to dine together once a month from now on.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.900
That's great.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.030
You'll have more time to talk with your family.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.510
She also said she wants to meet my boyfriend.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.420
Let's go together next time.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.610
What's wrong?

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.970
The bracelet I gave you the other day

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.360
actually...

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.670
it's part of a matching set.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.140
A heart?

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.920
A small, lonely heart

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:36.850
but

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.640
when putting it together with your bracelet

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.380
my heart

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.940
is inside of yours.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.790
Ai-san.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.340
- I fall in...
- Don't say it.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.250
Don't tell me the rest.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.280
Why not?

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.020
No.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:01.570
I don't want to hear it.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.940
Wait, Ai-san.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.120
Ai-san!

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:09.770
Ai-san.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.870
What are you doing?

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.540
I'm drafting a contract.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.520
What contract?

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.380
A new contract between us.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.930
- We don't need a contract.
- Yes, we do.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.210
- No, we don't.
- Yes, we do.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.640
No.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.250
- Just listen to me.
- No, Kaishin, you listen.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.560
- Stop talking.
- I love you.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.650
From the bottom of my heart.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.260
I love you.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.290
Why?

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.180
Why did you say it?

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.250
Because I wanted to.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.280
You know nothing.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.270
- Then tell me.
- Gotta be quick...

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.780
This new contract.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.210
Is 500,000 enough?

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:08.670
What?

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.480
A million?

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.400
Or one and a half million?

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.790
If it's two million...

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.840
that's probably too cheap for you.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.180
Stop it.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.630
It's enough.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:34.690
Two and a half million.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.770
- Three million, three and a half...
- I said stop it!

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.020
How much do I have to pay for your love?

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.270
- What are you talking about?
- I don't want any money.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.030
Money isn't what I want.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.030
I just want you.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.500
Let me love you.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:05.660
I can't.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.040
I don't need love.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.560
You don't have to love me

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:11.930
I don't want to get hurt.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.000
Don't talk about love.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.800
Get lost.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.300
I don't need it.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.390
I see.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.280
In that case.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.100
I don't want it back.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.770
My heart.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:54.730
I don't want you to give it back.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.560
Let me just say one last thing.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:05.450
I love you.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.060
I don't love you.

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.180
To truly fall in love with the ocean...

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.230
I guess it wasn't meant to be.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:25.800
Ocean's Love: Where Love Returns
(Episode 10)

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.510
Why is Himeka-san here too?

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:35.010
I invited her.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.080
Why?

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.150
I wanted to say goodbye to you both.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.020
I'm taking the boat tonight

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:44.900
to go back to the island.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.220
Why so suddenly?

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.840
I'm sorry.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.860
Then what about Teacher Ai?

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.020
You were the one who helped him grow.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.520
How can you just leave like this?

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.320
That's exactly why I asked you both to come.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.100
What do you mean?

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:06.780
Fumi-san and Himeka-san

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.480
you both know Ai-san very well.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.340
But

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.790
in my perspective.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:22.310
Ai-san is far more lonely

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.800
yet still yearns for people connection.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.480
So...

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.960
please go see him more often.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.750
Even if he acts annoyed, please be patient with him.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.900
If he asks for alcohol

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.600
give him coffee.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.950
If he won't eat

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.440
take away all the coffee.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.990
Then he'll eat.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:07.250
Wait a minute.

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.330
- But isn't that just...
- Please take care of him...

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:13.010
I'm counting on you.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:47.150
Are you really okay with this?

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:48.750
What are you asking all of a sudden?

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.080
About Kaishin.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.540
Why didn't you stop him?

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.640
Stop him?

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.420
Yeah, tell him not to go.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:55.530
"Stay by my side."

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.100
"Don't leave me." Something like that. Go after him!

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.560
Why should I...

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:01.130
Give me a break...

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.330
Don't give up

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.040
I'm already in agony.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:05.640
Do I really need to suffer any more?

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.010
Love and pain...

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:10.210
They're supposed to be different.

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:11.990
But the only love I've ever known

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.930
is synonymous with sorrow.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.400
Gosh...

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:34.760
I told you, I can't write.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.080
No matter how I want to.

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:39.290
When will it be finished? I want to know more than anyone.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.510
Is that so?

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:11.980
What are you thinking about?

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:14.090
Huh?

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.990
Oh.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.890
Teacher Ai and Kaishin-san.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.840
When you think about it

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.440
their story is like something out of a romance.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:29.930
Two people who are polar opposites

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.480
meet and fall in love.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:33.150
Love...

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.410
Kaishin loves Teacher.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.460
And Teacher loves Kaishin.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.300
For the first time, Teacher opened his heart to someone.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:45.750
Is it really that easy?

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.200
For someone with a painful past

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.230
who has always run from love

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.590
it's not easy to accept it.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.640
Over here.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.280
About the other day

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.460
- thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:02.740
Today.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.580
I have something to tell you

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.950
I am thinking of treating you some cake to show my gratitude.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.780
- Act cheeky again.
- Then how about a reward cake for acing my test?

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:14.730
Let's call it an advance, then.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.180
You scored an 8 out of 100 on your last test

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.580
8

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.060
That's a good number.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.750
Not so great if it's a test score, though.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:27.790
Is something wrong?

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.280
Oh, no.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:33.430
I was just thinking

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.440
about the number.

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:36.780
Does Uncle Kaishin like the number, too?

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.450
Uncle Ai has always loved it.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.660
The number 8 symbolizes eternity.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.750
If you turn it on its side,
it's the infinity symbol, isn't it?

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.630
Sounds just like what a romance novelist would say. So romantic.

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:49.190
When Ai was a kid

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:51.230
if he was rating things

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:53.380
he'd always give his favorite things an 8.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:55.820
In the toy store, it was "that's an 8, this is an 8".

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:56.540
Honestly.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:58.970
He was a kid who always kept us on our toes.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.380
So for Uncle Ai, an 8 means he'll love it forever.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:09.010
My score for Kaishin...

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:10.590
is an 8.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:12.800
Out of 100

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.000
isn't a failing grade?

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:18.670
I just like the number.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:33.640
Uncle Kaishin.

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:38.020
I am fine.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:11.790
Where is my bracelet?

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.960
Bracelet? What bracelet?

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.610
The one that was in the trash.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.310
I already took out the trash.

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:20.510
Where did you take it?

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:22.660
To the garbage dump.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.100
Unbelievable.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:35.250
It's gone.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:40.860
Wait.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:46.920
Hold on.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.580
You have to love the sea with all your heart.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:00.950
Let's make up.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:07.590
Can I hold you?

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.780
Just let me say one last thing.

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:22.690
I love you.

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:40.380
I'm sorry.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:46.450
Kaishin, I'm sorry.

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:53.810
Please come back.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.490
Please, just come back.

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:07.540
I...

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.680
was so happy being loved by you

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.070
but I was terrified you'd hate me.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.360
Please come back.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.180
Please...

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.720
Do you really want to throw this away?

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.700
- Give it back.
- So you can throw it away again?

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.200
Give it back to me

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.690
I'm not giving it back until you answer me.

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.160
I don't know what to do!

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:24.040
I'm so scared of loving someone.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.440
What can I do...

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.960
to make him stay by my side

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.020
the way sister and mom have always been?

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.080
When you're writing a novel

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.030
are you afraid no one will read it?

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.600
No.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:47.630
I write because I want to write.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.020
Exactly!

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:52.060
You can't be afraid of losing something you haven't lost yet.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:54.990
If you want to love, then love.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.810
Pain, sadness

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:00.930
even falling in or out of love

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.200
are all just part of the human beings.

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:08.620
But...

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:11.380
you'll never find happiness if you don't give love.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.010
You'll never know if it'll lead to happiness or sorrow...

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.090
unless you break down the walls around your heart.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.000
If you don't want to get hurt by losing someone

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:23.760
then you just have to cherish them while you can.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.880
How am I supposed to do that?

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.520
Kaishin made his choice to come here

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.520
now, it's your turn to choose, Ai.

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:43.960
As for me,

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:46.800
whatever my friend chooses

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:48.870
I'll be right there by his side.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.480
I...

00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:58.910
I want to love someone.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.740
And I want to be loved, too.

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.200
And if you get hurt,

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.600
we'll be here for you.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.200
Brother.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:08.710
That last customer...

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:10.850
already booked their next appointment.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.090
Kaishin's back at full power!

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:16.860
Brother?

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.270
Oh, right.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:20.770
That's great.

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:23.960
What are you doing back here?

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:25.590
Huh?

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.500
- Isn't you craving me to come back...
- Yeah, I know, but...

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:30.650
if you come back, come back in one piece.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:32.720
You look like a complete zombie.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.050
Like you left half of your soul back there.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:35.290
Leave me alone.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:36.940
Looking at you now,

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:38.900
I guess things didn't work out with that handsome rich guy.

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:42.480
He seemed unapproachable anyway.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.020
When he's hungry.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.510
I bet he's never had to lick salt just to survive.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.480
Don't just assume things.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.600
You know nothing about him.

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.810
I just wanted to help you vent your anger.

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:00.980
Mind your own business.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:03.860
But...

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.680
thanks for watching the shop.

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:09.790
Well, yeah...

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.230
I'm your right-hand man, after all.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:30.800
Huh?

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:42.620
Rich handsome guy...

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:44.500
It's you...

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.470
the one who stole half my brother's soul...

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:48.050
Kaishin...

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:49.270
Do you know where Kaishin is?

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.340
I don't know!

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:55.000
Kaishin!

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:56.940
Kaishin!

00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:58.740
Fine!

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:00.580
Okay, okay, I got it...

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:04.840
He was just out...

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:06.310
probably went...

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:08.660
- to that place he's been going to lately...
- Thank you.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.800
It's a pretty long run from here!

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.260
Kaishin!

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.060
Ai-san.

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:00.370
What are you doing here?

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:30.690
Kaishin.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:34.630
Are you here to hurt me?

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:36.430
What?

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.550
- No...
- I told you.

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:40.470
Don't return my heart back.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.590
- You've got it all wrong.
- Wrong about what?

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:46.220
My feelings aren't worthless to you.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.200
Did you come to tell me that you can
freely trample on my sincere feelings?

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:51.760
If you don't care, you should just throw it away.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.570
But you're pushing me be the one to do so.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:57.840
Hey!

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:06.730
You're the one who said...

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:10.080
You don't need love.

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:13.050
You don't want to love anyone.

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:16.540
Our relationship...

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.430
was just a contract.

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:23.840
It was my fault for forcing my feelings on you.

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:27.720
But I'm telling you

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.780
no matter how much money you pay

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.960
you can never go back.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.230
Because feelings are priceless.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.550
Go back and find someone else.

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:12.410
You throw it away.

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:16.410
Don't make me do it myself.

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:20.140
My heart...

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:25.590
Wait.

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:28.520
Wait for me, Kaishin!

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.040
Wait!

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:39.290
Please.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.160
Just...

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:50.560
listen to this.

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:01.570
I'm sorry, Kaishin.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.410
I hurt you.

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:07.680
I was selfish.

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:09.460
And I was a coward.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:11.810
I'm sorry.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.520
The words you want to hear...

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.140
I couldn't say them to your face.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.890
But with a recording

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.320
it's like writing an article

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:23.170
I can sort through my thoughts

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.320
and tell you what's really in my heart.

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:31.890
The only love I've ever known in my life...

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.050
was filled with pain and endless tears.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.030
That's why I was so scared.
I didn't know what to do.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:41.970
That's why I ran away from you

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.050
from your love.

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:47.740
You taught me...

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.470
those first fluttering feelings

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:52.850
and the happiness...

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:56.570
I want to wake up next to you in the morning...

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.010
and fall asleep in your arms at night.

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:01.890
I want to be able to tell you...

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.100
"I'm tired"

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:05.560
"I'm hungry."

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:08.380
I want to do things for you, too.

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:10.940
I want to cry with you...

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:12.590
and laugh with you.

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:14.930
I'm sorry.

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:16.740
I'm sorry for falling in love with you.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:18.810
It took me too long to realize it.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:20.880
I'm so sorry.

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:33.170
I love you.

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:36.590
Kaishin...

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:40.490
Yes?

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:42.820
Ai-san.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.320
Kaishin.

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:51.720
I'm right here.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.500
Kaishin...

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:07.070
I love you.

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.990
I'm sorry.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.710
I'm sorry for the awful things I said.

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:33.480
I'm sorry I hurt you.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:35.880
And...

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:37.290
You don't have to apologize anymore.

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:42.640
Then what should I do?

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:45.230
I'll do anything.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:47.420
Tell me.

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.310
How you feel about me?

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.580
Right now, to my face.

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:05.610
I love you.

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:09.260
I love Kaishin.

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.080
I love you.

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.160
I love you.

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:25.220
I've fallen in love with the sea with all my heart.

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.440
It came true.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.600
I love you, too.

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:42.040
From now on, and forever.

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:28.480
I can't just leave this island

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:31.110
I'll come over during the off-season.

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:32.890
So, that means...

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:34.470
we'll only see each other for half the year?

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:36.510
I don't want that.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:41.860
But I can't just leave this island.

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:45.040
This is my life.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.560
It's my home.

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:49.500
And there are people here who need me.

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:51.050
Then this is what we'll do.

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:52.820
The rest of the year

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:54.170
I'll come here.

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:56.490
I'm a writer. I can work from anywhere.

00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:58.080
Even if there are no med spas here.

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.790
I want to be with the one I love.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.890
I want to be with the one I love.

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:14.740
I've never

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:16.860
understood myself all this time.

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:20.550
He was the one who stripped away my armor

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.510
filled my naked heart

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.700
with overflowing tenderness.

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:29.020
That's why I can say now.

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:31.730
What love means...

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:34.110
is me being together with you

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.580
as it should be.

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:56.970
Kaishin.

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:00.230
I'm finally finished.

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:02.810
You must be exhausted.

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:05.010
Just as I'd expect from you

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.300
you are a true genius.

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.080
Your complement...

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.990
is making me blush.

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:12.890
When did you learn the island dialect?

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:15.270
I love you.

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:16.750
Kaishin.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.200
I love you.

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:20.740
Ai-san.

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:29.340
Ai-san, are you tired?

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:32.310
So tired.

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:34.290
I'm wiped.

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.200
Kaishin.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:12.600
Yeah?

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:16.460
You have to love, you know.

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:21.310
I already do
