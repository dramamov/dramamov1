[Episode 19]

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.840
Mr. Ye,

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.200
the board has sent word.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.510
They believe the group's severe losses
in recent years

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.350
are tied to your decision-making.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.870
Go on.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.840
At this year's shareholders' meeting,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.120
they intend to remove you

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.280
from the chairman position.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.760
How dare they?

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.480
This is rebellion!

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.510
Mr. Ye, please calm down.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.590
The group has set a goal

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.560
to secure the agency rights for Drizzt.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.560
They said

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.230
they want to see your performance
on this project.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.920
What are our chances
with the Drizzt project?

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.590
From what I know,

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.510
Ji Baijian's Zhifu Jewelry
is also making a move.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.640
That Ji Baijian again.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.640
We absolutely
can't let him succeed this time.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.350
Don't worry.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.950
If we win the bid for Drizzt,

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.000
we can proceed with a smooth IPO.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.960
That will shut

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.240
those old fossils on the board up.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.030
Guanshu. Find a way

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.430
to get Ji Baijian's bidding plan.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.870
Ji Baijian is always very cautious.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.240
I'm afraid it might be difficult.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.030
Perhaps

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.310
there's someone who can help us.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.800
Who?

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.960
Song Zhizhi.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.190
Song Zhizhi?

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.000
She would help us?

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.240
Last time we ruined things for her.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.680
She doesn't like us very much.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.120
Of course she doesn't.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.430
But right now,

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.400
her father's company
has been hollowed out,

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.080
and she was deceived.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.360
She's caught between love and hatred.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.400
She's a rich girl.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.360
What she hates most
is being made a fool of.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.960
If you hand her a knife right now,

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.360
she'd be only too grateful.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.630
Zhizhi, you're still working?

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.840
What brings you here?

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.430
Back in the day, Starlight Jewelry
was full of talent.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.870
Look how quiet it is now.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.190
You're basically manning the ship
all by yourself now, huh?

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.750
Times have changed.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.630
Mr. Ye,

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.240
if you're here to mock me,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
you can leave now.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.240
What kind of talk is that?

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.310
I'd never mock you.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.030
You're still mad at me, aren't you?

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.430
Alright.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.280
Let me give you a sincere apology.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.750
Let's not let
this misunderstanding get worse.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.840
I was just trying to do you a favor
and remind you

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.630
to watch out for Ji Baijian
and his father.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.040
I never expected...

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.310
I didn't expect to ruin her marriage.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.040
But speaking of which,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.390
I actually think she and Baijian

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.630
make a great couple. Right?

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.160
Mr. Ye.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.720
There's no need for this.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.390
Oh, look at you.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.270
I've apologized.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.830
Why are you still being so distant?

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.360
Kid, let me tell you,

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.480
the business world is a battlefield.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.750
If you're not careful
in judging people or handling matters,

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.390
you can easily fall into a trap.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.430
I couldn't bear to just watch you
fall into a trap!

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.120
You came to see me

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.070
for a reason, didn't you?

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.750
Stop beating around the bush.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.190
Get straight to the point.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.630
See?

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.270
Zhizhi's so perceptive.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.630
Let's get down to business.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.270
I'll be blunt then.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.190
The group is preparing to bid

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.480
for the Drizzt agency rights project.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.680
You know

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.750
how crucial this bid is for the group.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.070
But I've heard

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.430
that Ji Baijian
seems to be involved as well.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.430
Jihong Group

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.560
has always been Starlight Group's

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.360
most formidable competitor.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.070
So

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.040
I'd like to ask for your help.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.720
See if you can get their

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.950
bidding plan.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.390
Knowing the enemy
gives us a greater chance of victory.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.950
Isn't that right?

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:45.240
Mr. Ye,

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.560
what makes you so sure
I'll help you?

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.830
Because

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.040
I have something you want.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:57.310
That confident?

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.510
Say it.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.000
What do you want?

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.680
Since you're being direct,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.190
I won't beat around the bush.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.020
I want the list of renowned

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.740
ancient gold crafting artisans
in the country,

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.460
and the list
of raw jewelry material suppliers.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.260
Zhizhi, you're asking for a lot.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.580
Compared to securing
the agency rights for Drizzt,

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.580
it's not that much, is it?

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.020
Besides, if Starlight Jewelry
is to be rebuilt

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.860
and compete with Zhifu Jewelry,

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.300
wouldn't that only work in your favor?

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.380
But I know Ji Baijian

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:39.780
quite well.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.540
He's meticulous and cautious.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.140
Getting that plan

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.300
might not be so simple.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.060
I'll need time.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.300
Zhizhi,

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.980
some things

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.740
are more complicated than you think.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.540
Starlight Jewelry has been hollowed out
by the Ji family.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.420
Its operations

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.180
are in shambles.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.820
Rebuilding it is easier said than done.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:11.420
Mr. Ye,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.460
if I recall correctly,

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.500
you came here to ask for my help.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.820
If you don't think I'm capable,

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.140
then you should just leave.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:23.820
Look at you.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.020
Always so blunt,

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.740
forgetting your place.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.020
If I didn't think you were capable,

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.660
I wouldn't be here.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.540
Help me get the plan,

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.220
and I promise we'll work together

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.020
to rebuild Starlight Jewelry.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.100
I'll be waiting for your good news.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:46.900
We're leaving.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.740
This kid is something else. Let's go.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:07:59.700
Guanshu.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.860
Say what you will about Zhizhi,

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.460
but she always thinks
of her father's interests.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.100
That's the benefit of having children.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:11.420
Not like me,

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.500
fighting the old generation,
then the young.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.060
Ended up all alone.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.460
Mr. Ye, I will always be
your right-hand man.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.060
Guanshu, go to the garage
and wait for me with the car.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:35.980
I'll be right down.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:37.660
Alright.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.500
Come on, spill it. What's happening?

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.220
Sir, after searching for over 20 years,

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.220
we finally have a lead on Da.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:50.540
She talked?

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.060
Yes. She said Da is still alive.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:53.900
I'll verify it as soon as I can.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:54.900
Alright.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.300
Once confirmed,
she's no longer needed.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.060
She knows too much.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:08.380
Hello?

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.420
Mr. Ji, about that batch
of rough gemstones

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.700
for Dafu Jewelry

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:14.980
you asked about last time,

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.180
I've got some new leads.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.020
I've sent you an email.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.140
Take a look.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:22.540
Alright.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.020
What are these photos?

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.700
We take photos of all materials
during inventory check-in

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.220
and check-out.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.380
After your visit,

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.020
I still couldn't find any information
on who picked up those gemstones.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.460
But a couple of days ago,

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.540
while I was organizing the archives,

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.300
I found these photos

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.820
from that batch.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.780
When taking photos of a crate
of rough gemstones being shipped out,

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.020
we seem to have accidentally

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.460
captured the person who picked them up.

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.820
Are you saying the person in this photo

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.900
is the one who took the gemstones?

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:08.940
That's correct, Mr. Ji.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.020
I don't know who he is.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:12.500
I sent them to you.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.620
Hope it helps.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.140
Alright, thank you.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:51.700
Hello?

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.340
Zhizhi, where are you?

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.140
Haven't I made myself clear?

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:58.580
Stop bothering me.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.580
I've found out the truth
about the rough gemstones.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.300
And it concerns your dad.

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.820
So, can I come see you?

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.500
I'm at the office.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.780
Alright, I'm on my way.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:13.860
Ji Baijian,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.540
I'm only seeing you because of my dad.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.300
I believe he would never

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:21.660
do anything so heinous.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:26.940
Alright.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:28.060
I know.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:49.500
How have you been?

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.140
What do you think?

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.900
I've found out the truth
about the rough gemstones.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.500
My trip to Italy

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.260
was to investigate the pickup order.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.540
But there was no signature on it.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.100
So you just assumed it was my dad?

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:09.500
It wasn't me suspecting him.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:11.660
My dad believed

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.460
that since the gemstones ended up
in your warehouse,

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.940
your dad must have been involved.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.460
I found the person
who picked those gemstones up.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.140
It's Qian Guanshu in the photo.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.860
So it must have something to do
with Ye Taiting.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:40.820
So it really is Ye Taiting.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.260
He framed my dad,

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.780
which led to all that harm.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.380
Including your mother's passing.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.340
I'm sorry.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.060
I'm sorry, Zhizhi.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.700
I owe your dad an apology too.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.060
I never wanted to see Starlight Jewelry

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.340
end up like this.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.420
Losing you

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.660
is such a harsh punishment for me.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.500
Can you just give me a...?

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.060
Stop.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:14.260
You should go now.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:32.140
I'm sorry.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.760
[Ji Baijian has come
to see Song Zhizhi.]

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.640
[Sent]

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:05.500
Mr. Ye.

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:07.740
Look.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:22.860
Good.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.580
Keep a close watch on them.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:36.360
[Yi Wenhan]

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.280
[Yi Wenhan]

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:04.180
Wenhan.

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.620
You think I can't find you

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.420
just because you're hiding from me?

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:09.900
Wenhan,

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:11.220
I'm your dad.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.260
I'm not going to hide from you
or abandon you.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:14.300
Dad?

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.900
You've manipulated me
with emotional lies for years.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:19.780
You think I still believe you?

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.660
When will I get the money
and see my mom?

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:26.820
Wenhan,

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.460
that's a huge sum.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.100
I need time.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:31.220
Fine.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.140
Then don't blame me for what's coming.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.420
Let's see if Ye Taiting
will still tolerate you

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.020
once he knows everything.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.780
What do you want?

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:47.260
Three days.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:49.140
You have three days.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.060
I want the money,
and I want to see my mom.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.820
Then don't blame me for getting tough.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:19.100
Hello?

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:20.180
Mr. Ji,

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.340
the board members are not supportive
of Zhifu Jewelry

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.900
bidding for the Drizzt project.
Should we continue?

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:27.540
I know.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.260
I know the shareholders

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.340
have strong opinions
about the Drizzt project.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:35.900
I'll speak with them personally.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.100
Zhizhi.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.780
I was just passing by
and thought I'd check on you.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.660
Mr. Ye, you've been coming to me
repeatedly lately.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.020
What do you want?

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.860
I see you're full of ambition,

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.460
pushing so hard to rebuild
your father's company.

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:17.420
I was worried you might be
overworking yourself.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.660
Just wanted to see
how you're holding up.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.140
There's no need for you
to worry about my work.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.860
So, how is it going

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.660
with that matter I asked you about?

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.740
So you're here to check on the progress.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.140
Not exactly. Well,

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.300
we're clear-headed.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.660
Let me be frank with you.

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.860
I've enlisted others

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.260
within Zhifu Jewelry

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.980
to help me with this project as well.

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.220
So

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.500
you're not my only card to play.

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.900
But I can tell you for sure

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.460
that no one but Starlight Group

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:01.460
can give you

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.740
what you want.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:11.820
Mr. Ye.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.100
You've certainly done your homework.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:16.900
You might not know.

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:18.740
But Ji Baijian

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.700
is personally overseeing this project.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.720
[Ji Baijian]
[Zhizhi, I'm sorry.]

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.340
For a project personally overseen
by Ji Baijian,

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.180
all the core secrets

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.380
are undoubtedly in his hands.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.500
Those small fries at the company

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:44.300
are useless.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.540
The only one of your cards

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:49.700
who can get that file from him

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:51.300
is me.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:53.300
Be patient.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.620
I am patient.

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.020
I have plenty of patience.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:11.260
Alright then, Zhizhi,

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.340
I'll let you get back to work.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.020
See yourself out.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.300
Okay. Alright.

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:05.940
Ji Baijian,

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:07.900
where are you?

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:09.860
I need to see you.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:22.460
Zhizhi,

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.100
I didn't expect you to reach out.

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:26.660
Does this mean you forgive me?

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:28.300
Get in the car first.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:31.780
Let's go.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.780
See that car over there?

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.420
Are we being followed?

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.100
Ye Taiting's men.

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.020
Did he do anything to you?

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:55.500
Ye Taiting came to see me.

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.700
He wanted to discuss a deal.

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:00.660
A deal?

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.260
He wants me to get

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:05.940
Zhifu Jewelry's bidding plan

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.420
for the Drizzt project from you.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:09.940
So he had someone follow me

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:10.940
and keep an eye on me.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.300
In exchange, he said...

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:17.740
Zhizhi,

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.700
you know what Ye Taiting is like.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.380
Don't let him fool you.

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:25.620
If you want something,

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.060
whatever Ye Taiting is offering,
I can...

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:27.500
You can't give it to me.

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:30.980
And I don't trust you anymore.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.140
But to be honest,

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:37.900
Ji Baijian,

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:40.140
even though you lied to me,

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:42.500
I don't want to harm you.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.100
So I won't steal your plan.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.620
I came to see you

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.460
to propose we work together.

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.500
Let's put on a show for him.

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:51.580
Thank you.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:55.740
Thank you for telling me.

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:57.180
No need to thank me.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.460
I'm not doing this for you.

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:01.500
I just don't want to compromise

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.060
my own professional ethics.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:06.900
I think we share a common goal

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.980
when it comes to

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:12.540
dealing with Ye Taiting.

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.900
So I want you to help me get

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:18.980
what I want.

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:22.740
What do you need me to do?

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.220
I need you to prepare
a fake bidding plan.

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.180
Make it detailed.

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:27.700
Make Ye Taiting believe it.

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.100
After this is over,

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.780
I want to buy twenty percent
of your shares

in Starlight Jewelry.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:41.580
Alright.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:43.700
I agree.

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:47.940
Let's go then.

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:21.380

Let's go to your place.

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.100
Have you been

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:51.140
having a tough time lately?

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:54.500
Not really.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:56.860
Just a lot going on recently.

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:00.900
Is there anything I can do to help?

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:02.660
I don't need your help.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.580
You should rest when we get home.

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:09.540
I'll make something to eat.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.980
It's late.
You probably don't have time to eat.

You must be hungry.

What is it?

Mr. Ye,

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.220
we have news about your son.

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:57.420
After multiple confirmations,

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.940
the news is absolutely reliable.

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:01.140
You'll never guess who it is.

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:17.660
Ziming, you've been working hard.

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:18.660
Here, let me toast you.

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:23.180
Mr. Ye,

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:25.660
what's the occasion for this dinner?

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.660
I've been wanting to find time
to sit down with you.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.180
Qian has spoken to you, hasn't he?

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.580
So I wanted to take this opportunity

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.100
to ask you directly.

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.460
Would you like
to take a position in the group?

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:45.980
I made myself very clear to Mr. Qian.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.420
I must repay

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.020
the Song family's kindness.

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.780
I'm afraid I'll have to
disappoint you, Mr. Ye.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.340
Not at all.

00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.940
For a young man,

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.180
you have such a strong sense of loyalty.

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:02.580
I admire that.

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:03.860
By the way,

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:08.300
you're also fond of Zhizhi, aren't you?

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.340
You've been investigating me?

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.580
That's my personal matter.

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:15.420
You're overstepping.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:18.300
I'm afraid

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:20.420
I can't continue this meal.

Ziming.

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:26.100
I know,

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.860
as the Song family's adopted kid,

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:30.620
you have some prejudices against me.

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.300
I totally understand.

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:33.820
But

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.140
I still have to show you something.

Just trying to learn.

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.060
I've realized I simply don't understand,

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.500
and don't know how to build
any kind of intimate relationship.

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:02.340

only by resolving your own issues
