(Previously)
So, Lin and Nut

00:00:02.979 --> 00:00:04.312
are not dating?

00:00:04.784 --> 00:00:07.032
How did you get your parents
to let us practice here again?

00:00:07.344 --> 00:00:09.277
It was nothing, just asked nicely.

00:00:09.288 --> 00:00:10.207
How did you get here?

00:00:10.232 --> 00:00:11.327
Don't ask questions.

00:00:11.352 --> 00:00:12.654
Let's just go practice.

00:00:14.108 --> 00:00:15.588
The thing you want to tell me...

00:00:15.608 --> 00:00:17.242
I like you too.

00:00:17.292 --> 00:00:18.299
Where are you going?

00:00:19.325 --> 00:00:21.059
I promise that if I don't win,

00:00:21.398 --> 00:00:23.812
I will quit playing music as you wish.

00:00:24.083 --> 00:00:26.316
A brain tumor has been detected.

00:00:27.102 --> 00:00:28.522
Where's Nut?

00:00:28.955 --> 00:00:30.228
He'll probably be here soon.

"Rearrange"
(Episode 9)

00:02:07.184 --> 00:02:08.284
Hey, bro!

00:02:09.723 --> 00:02:11.554
Are you okay? Are you alright?

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:12.768
Careful.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.986
Are you okay?

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.212
Sir, please take me to the competition in Soi 12.

00:02:21.445 --> 00:02:23.046
You'll have to show me the way.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.801
Thank you very much.

00:02:23.825 --> 00:02:24.740
Follow me.

00:02:24.765 --> 00:02:25.954
Careful.

00:02:50.614 --> 00:02:51.809
Hey, Nut.

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:53.176
What happened?

00:02:53.522 --> 00:02:54.415
Don't ask yet.

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:55.766
Find me some clothes to change.

00:03:08.427 --> 00:03:10.053
Do I look okay?

00:03:12.494 --> 00:03:14.176
I think you should put on some makeup.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.555
It'll make you look fresher.

00:03:17.264 --> 00:03:18.191
Biu.

00:03:18.575 --> 00:03:20.383
Do you have any makeup I can borrow?

00:03:21.212 --> 00:03:22.358
I don't have any.

00:03:23.807 --> 00:03:24.853
What about you, Lin?

00:03:26.952 --> 00:03:28.505
I didn't bring any.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.317
Hey guys, it's almost time.

00:03:38.814 --> 00:03:39.727
Okay.

00:03:39.952 --> 00:03:40.999
Wait a minute.

00:03:41.522 --> 00:03:42.422
Yes?

00:03:44.066 --> 00:03:45.885
Do you have any makeup I can borrow?

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.036
Honestly,

00:04:03.616 --> 00:04:04.942
if you're not well,

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.912
I'd rather you be at the hospital.

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:11.802
How are you guys going to win without me?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.910
I have to finish this competition.

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:28.531
Trust me.

00:04:28.951 --> 00:04:30.038
I'm fine.

00:04:51.548 --> 00:04:52.808
Shit.

00:04:53.188 --> 00:04:54.673
I went to check the stage.

00:04:54.697 --> 00:04:56.252
Those guys played like gods.

00:04:56.931 --> 00:04:58.790
You're usually so confident.

00:04:58.814 --> 00:05:00.270
Are you getting scared now?

00:05:00.295 --> 00:05:01.587
Just listen.

00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:04.247
Here, here.

00:05:07.997 --> 00:05:09.625
The drums are so tight.

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:11.044
The bass is so smooth.

00:05:11.841 --> 00:05:13.075
I don't think we can make it.

00:05:14.295 --> 00:05:15.529
Listen to me, guys.

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:18.082
The fact that our band has come this far

00:05:18.466 --> 00:05:20.362
means that we're not inferior to anyone.

00:05:25.333 --> 00:05:27.925
Trust me, we can do this.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.800
I can do it, I can do it.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.584
I can do it, I can do it, I can do it.

00:05:37.187 --> 00:05:38.360
Let's do it.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.641
Let's give it a shot.

00:05:39.665 --> 00:05:41.146
Let's power up.

00:05:44.095 --> 00:05:45.262
Come on.

00:05:47.553 --> 00:05:49.390
3, 2, 1.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.177
Yeah!

00:05:54.458 --> 00:05:56.167
Hey guys, if you're ready,

00:05:56.191 --> 00:05:57.805
please standby backstage.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.587
Let's go.

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.414
I'll go wait and film in the front.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.116
Good luck.

00:06:06.456 --> 00:06:07.529
Let's go.

00:06:09.948 --> 00:06:10.803
Hey.

00:06:11.235 --> 00:06:13.043
Your face could make you a star.

00:06:13.625 --> 00:06:15.291
Don't tease me, just go.

00:06:17.255 --> 00:06:18.089
Here you go.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.620
Thank you.

00:06:21.705 --> 00:06:22.865
You're welcome.

00:06:25.957 --> 00:06:27.590
Please welcome the band "TIMELIED" to the stage.

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:47.489

Nut!

00:08:59.363 --> 00:09:00.232
Nut!

00:09:01.076 --> 00:09:01.945
Nut!

00:09:02.488 --> 00:09:04.135
Nut!

00:09:04.721 --> 00:09:05.590
Nut!

00:09:39.223 --> 00:09:40.463
Did we win?

00:09:45.379 --> 00:09:47.201
You never told us anything.

00:09:48.029 --> 00:09:49.116
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:09:54.563 --> 00:09:56.571
I was going to tell you guys after the competition.

00:09:57.331 --> 00:09:58.817
If I knew, I wouldn't have let you compete.

00:10:13.395 --> 00:10:14.941
The doctor has scheduled the surgery.

00:10:22.839 --> 00:10:24.132
You're going to be okay, Nut.

00:10:25.998 --> 00:10:27.191
I promise.

00:11:03.063 --> 00:11:04.403
Thanks.

00:11:04.775 --> 00:11:05.928
Aek.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:12.444
Is something wrong?

00:11:16.907 --> 00:11:18.160
Are you worried about Nut?

00:11:19.328 --> 00:11:20.423
Don't worry about him.

00:11:20.447 --> 00:11:21.961
He'll be fine, trust me.

00:11:23.507 --> 00:11:24.289
How about this?

00:11:24.313 --> 00:11:25.595
Let's go get something to eat tomorrow.

00:11:27.137 --> 00:11:28.774
I probably have tutoring at school.

00:11:32.202 --> 00:11:34.982
If we don't have practice anymore,

00:11:35.931 --> 00:11:37.244
will we still see each other?

00:11:39.633 --> 00:11:41.027
I'll call you.

00:12:07.356 --> 00:12:09.183
Can I walk with you?

00:12:09.483 --> 00:12:10.417
Mmm.

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:15.618
Are you worried about Nut?

00:12:16.362 --> 00:12:19.001
Mmm, I'm worried about him.

00:12:19.721 --> 00:12:21.983
I know I can't be more than this.

00:12:22.496 --> 00:12:23.870
But I'm still worried about him.

00:12:26.942 --> 00:12:29.050
Nut is going to be fine, trust me.

00:12:29.878 --> 00:12:30.678
Mmm.

00:13:01.418 --> 00:13:02.472
Come on, son.

00:13:03.335 --> 00:13:05.802
If you don't win this time,
there's always a next time.

00:13:09.589 --> 00:13:11.109
Win is the best.

00:13:11.526 --> 00:13:13.172
You'll definitely win.

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:14.983
Yes.

00:13:16.225 --> 00:13:17.340
And also,

00:13:17.364 --> 00:13:19.985
the next time there's a singing competition,

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:22.572
I'll take you to sign up myself.

00:13:56.304 --> 00:13:57.371
Where are your parents?

00:13:57.764 --> 00:13:59.037
My dad went to work.

00:13:59.523 --> 00:14:00.917
My mom probably went to buy food.

00:14:10.385 --> 00:14:11.452
Are you okay?

00:14:12.944 --> 00:14:14.257
I'm great.

00:14:15.299 --> 00:14:17.392
You don't have to come see me every day.

00:14:19.156 --> 00:14:20.111
No.

00:14:20.957 --> 00:14:23.743
I miss you, can't I come see you?

00:14:24.967 --> 00:14:26.074
Of course.

00:14:26.478 --> 00:14:28.078
I miss you too.

00:14:29.359 --> 00:14:31.012
It has to be like this.

00:14:35.404 --> 00:14:37.679
So when do you have to go to Bangkok?

00:14:39.354 --> 00:14:40.967
Probably tomorrow morning.

00:14:41.842 --> 00:14:43.136
My mom said that

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.561
the doctor scheduled for the evening.

00:14:50.542 --> 00:14:53.518
And did the doctor say

00:14:53.542 --> 00:14:55.289
if it will be completely cured after the surgery?

00:14:58.485 --> 00:15:00.313
The doctor couldn't confirm.

00:15:02.079 --> 00:15:03.605
It depends on many things.

00:15:08.206 --> 00:15:09.166
Win.

00:15:11.236 --> 00:15:12.384
I promise.

00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:15.782
After the surgery is done,

00:15:17.305 --> 00:15:18.992
I'll come back to you first.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.572
When did I buy this?

00:15:31.883 --> 00:15:33.570
Wooow.

00:15:34.711 --> 00:15:36.547
Ah, the sleeve is torn.

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:55.300
Oh, this song was so cool back then.

00:15:55.325 --> 00:15:56.153
The rhythm is so good.

00:15:56.178 --> 00:15:57.935
It's like, "ting, ting, ting," and then the vocals.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.006
"Ting, ting, ting," and then the vocals.

00:15:59.031 --> 00:16:01.961
And then, "boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!"

00:16:02.789 --> 00:16:04.696
Awesome, so cool.

00:16:07.648 --> 00:16:08.821
Is something wrong?

00:16:11.605 --> 00:16:14.000
When you knew Mom wasn't going to make it,

00:16:15.252 --> 00:16:16.278
what did you do?

00:16:27.772 --> 00:16:29.170
I just told your mom

00:16:30.602 --> 00:16:32.442
to be at ease.

00:16:34.067 --> 00:16:35.320
Not to worry.

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:37.562
Because I'm good at being alone.

00:16:39.314 --> 00:16:40.948
Even though, in reality...

00:16:41.954 --> 00:16:43.394
I wasn't good at it at all.

00:16:50.522 --> 00:16:52.070
Let's party.

00:16:52.548 --> 00:16:53.881
Hello, Dad.

00:16:55.803 --> 00:16:58.239
Okay, it's my time now.

00:16:58.364 --> 00:16:59.738
Make yourselves at home.

00:17:10.772 --> 00:17:12.225
Are you okay?

00:17:16.892 --> 00:17:18.596
How did you know I'm not okay?

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.791
Well,

00:17:19.884 --> 00:17:21.257
Nut is having surgery tomorrow.

00:17:21.596 --> 00:17:22.717
Lin told me.

00:17:28.659 --> 00:17:30.899
We're all very worried about Nut.

00:17:31.392 --> 00:17:33.810
But Nut probably wouldn't want to see us so down, right?

00:17:34.187 --> 00:17:35.232
True.

00:17:35.335 --> 00:17:37.509
That's why I invited everyone here.

00:17:39.986 --> 00:17:41.326
Not everyone is here.

00:17:42.109 --> 00:17:44.903
Oh, Aek couldn't make it.

00:17:44.927 --> 00:17:47.325
He said he has a lot of tutoring for his exams.

00:17:54.667 --> 00:17:55.602
Come on.

00:17:55.627 --> 00:17:56.882
Let's have a toast.

00:17:57.098 --> 00:17:58.373
Come on, cheers.

00:17:58.588 --> 00:17:59.836
Let's do it.

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.965
Let's send our support to Nut. Let's go!

00:18:02.213 --> 00:18:03.727
Yay~

00:18:03.847 --> 00:18:05.410
You should say "yay" too.

00:18:05.434 --> 00:18:06.768
Again, 1, 2, 3.

00:18:06.793 --> 00:18:08.092
Yay~

00:18:11.969 --> 00:18:13.333
Refreshing.

00:18:13.632 --> 00:18:15.427
Thank you all so much.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.102
I feel much better.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.865
But why didn't you buy me some red soda?

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:23.920
Hey, who bought these?

00:18:24.153 --> 00:18:25.430
There are only 3?

00:18:26.064 --> 00:18:27.285
I didn't buy them.

00:18:27.832 --> 00:18:28.972
It's okay.

00:18:29.583 --> 00:18:30.616
Hey.

00:18:33.012 --> 00:18:33.978
No.

00:18:34.003 --> 00:18:35.538
Give it to me.

00:18:35.671 --> 00:18:37.838
Then the watermelon is mine.

00:18:37.863 --> 00:18:38.718
Hey.

00:18:39.703 --> 00:18:40.777
Hey, hey, hey.

00:18:40.802 --> 00:18:42.257
Let me have a piece.

00:18:50.116 --> 00:18:51.302
Daranphop.

00:18:52.809 --> 00:18:53.869
Daranphop!

00:18:55.242 --> 00:18:56.189
Yes, teacher.

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.675
What was I just talking about?

00:19:02.234 --> 00:19:04.280
The history of Ayutthaya.

00:19:05.489 --> 00:19:06.375
What?

00:19:06.464 --> 00:19:08.450
The history of Ayutthaya.

00:19:09.612 --> 00:19:12.373
The history of American, sir.

00:19:12.397 --> 00:19:13.204
Huh?

00:19:13.636 --> 00:19:14.857
America?

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:16.980
Sigh.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.059
Even with a friend helping,

00:19:19.083 --> 00:19:20.490
you still got it wrong.

00:19:21.483 --> 00:19:24.234
If you two want to whisper so much,

00:19:24.533 --> 00:19:26.009
go whisper outside the classroom.

00:19:26.034 --> 00:19:27.535
Sir, but...

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.638
No buts.

00:19:29.317 --> 00:19:31.430
Go stand on one leg outside the classroom now.

00:19:36.027 --> 00:19:37.062
Hurry up.

00:19:48.755 --> 00:19:50.369
In your past life,

00:19:52.145 --> 00:19:53.540
Nut didn't survive, right?

00:19:59.697 --> 00:20:00.683
Mmm.

00:20:03.204 --> 00:20:06.927
And do you think in this life,

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.689
anything can be changed?

00:20:14.682 --> 00:20:16.194
Honestly, I don't know.

00:20:20.372 --> 00:20:21.585
But at least in this life,

00:20:23.043 --> 00:20:24.863
I got to do what I wanted to do.

00:20:26.563 --> 00:20:27.627
Do what?

00:20:32.067 --> 00:20:33.347
Maybe you...

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:37.155
Yes.

00:20:37.689 --> 00:20:38.869
I...

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:40.784
I confessed my love to him.

00:20:41.478 --> 00:20:42.471
Shit.

00:20:43.341 --> 00:20:45.514
Why didn't you tell me?

00:20:47.382 --> 00:20:49.329
And what happened?

00:20:50.373 --> 00:20:51.946
I'm not telling you.

00:20:55.975 --> 00:20:57.408
"I'm not telling you."

00:20:58.621 --> 00:20:59.956
If you don't tell me,

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.225
I'll find out anyway.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.225
Hey.

00:21:05.572 --> 00:21:07.014
What are you two talking about?

00:21:07.957 --> 00:21:09.483
Do you want to get in trouble again?

00:21:10.138 --> 00:21:11.588
You're still talking even though

00:21:11.612 --> 00:21:13.220
you're being punished.

00:22:01.521 --> 00:22:02.595
Win.

00:22:03.595 --> 00:22:05.056
So this is where you are.

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.209
I was so worried.

00:22:06.233 --> 00:22:07.898
I went to your house but you weren't there.

00:22:13.859 --> 00:22:16.073
After the surgery, he won't be back right away.

00:22:16.097 --> 00:22:17.911
He'll have to stay in the hospital for a while.

00:22:18.417 --> 00:22:19.981
If you're this impatient,

00:22:20.005 --> 00:22:21.538
you should just follow him to Bangkok.

00:22:24.669 --> 00:22:26.286
Even if I followed him to Bangkok,

00:22:26.883 --> 00:22:28.670
I still wouldn't know which hospital he's at.

00:22:28.816 --> 00:22:31.429
Oh, and in your past life...

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:35.905
In my past life...

00:22:37.214 --> 00:22:38.873
Nut died while he was still here.

00:22:39.195 --> 00:22:40.077
Hey.

00:22:40.102 --> 00:22:41.768
So that means we have hope.

00:22:42.412 --> 00:22:43.352
Right?

00:22:46.586 --> 00:22:48.406
But I don't dare to hope, Biu.

00:22:51.768 --> 00:22:52.742
Come on.

00:22:52.767 --> 00:22:54.158
If you keep standing here,

00:22:54.182 --> 00:22:56.020
the doctor won't operate any better.

00:22:57.812 --> 00:22:59.172
Let's go get some ice cream with me.

00:22:59.196 --> 00:22:59.872
Come on.

00:23:01.778 --> 00:23:03.158
Come on.

00:23:03.183 --> 00:23:05.139
I'll give you 2 scoops.

00:23:05.962 --> 00:23:07.542
Give me your backpack, I'll carry it.

00:23:55.277 --> 00:23:56.697
Pass the chicken.

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.080
Sir, your water.

00:24:08.348 --> 00:24:09.293
Aek.

00:24:09.469 --> 00:24:11.020
Is the food not good, son?

00:24:12.943 --> 00:24:14.898
No, I just don't have an appetite.

00:24:18.701 --> 00:24:19.595
Aek.

00:24:20.324 --> 00:24:21.494
You know, right?

00:24:22.809 --> 00:24:23.842
That you

00:24:23.867 --> 00:24:25.964
can talk to your mom and dad

00:24:25.988 --> 00:24:28.390
about any of your problems.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:30.513
Okay, son?

00:24:32.539 --> 00:24:34.176
Let's eat, son.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.694
I'll serve you some chicken.

00:24:36.674 --> 00:24:38.617
Here, eat a lot.

00:24:38.641 --> 00:24:39.670
It's all protein.

00:24:44.998 --> 00:24:47.480
I haven't been feeling like myself lately.

00:24:48.053 --> 00:24:49.550
I just keep thinking about the same thing

00:24:49.574 --> 00:24:51.130
over and over.

00:24:52.652 --> 00:24:54.004
When I think about it,

00:24:54.028 --> 00:24:55.601
I can't stop thinking about it.

00:24:58.034 --> 00:25:00.129
Is there anything I can do to help, son?

00:25:16.311 --> 00:25:18.161
He probably already left you.

00:25:18.185 --> 00:25:19.886
You just find someone new.

00:25:20.312 --> 00:25:21.629
Oh, Mom.

00:25:21.653 --> 00:25:23.507
Aren't you going to cheer for us to make it?

00:25:24.103 --> 00:25:25.547
He's a rich man's son.

00:25:26.606 --> 00:25:28.469
But he's a rich man's son.

00:25:28.493 --> 00:25:30.842
And what do you have to compare to him,

00:25:31.194 --> 00:25:32.310
huh?

00:25:43.033 --> 00:25:44.087
Here.

00:25:44.365 --> 00:25:45.333
Cheers.

00:25:45.476 --> 00:25:46.956
With orange juice?

00:25:47.342 --> 00:25:48.442
Anything goes.

00:25:49.692 --> 00:25:50.805
Come on.

00:25:51.831 --> 00:25:53.085
Okay, okay.

00:26:02.123 --> 00:26:03.723
You can toast with orange juice.

00:26:04.094 --> 00:26:06.191
Why did you waste money buying alcohol?

00:26:09.452 --> 00:26:10.772
Don't fall.

00:26:14.109 --> 00:26:15.458
Oh no, no, no.

00:26:17.234 --> 00:26:18.849
Oh, got hit.

00:26:30.439 --> 00:26:31.556
Hello, Nut.

00:26:32.432 --> 00:26:33.900
Can I speak to Pod, please?

00:26:34.424 --> 00:26:35.894
There's no one named Pod here.

00:26:37.306 --> 00:26:38.657
Sorry, wrong number.

00:26:45.552 --> 00:26:46.900
Start over, start over.

00:26:46.924 --> 00:26:49.140
Win, You're waiting for a long time.

00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:51.430
If something happened to Nut,

00:26:51.454 --> 00:26:53.100
someone would have called by now.

00:26:54.974 --> 00:26:56.372
But if Nut wakes up,

00:26:56.598 --> 00:26:58.158
someone would have to call too.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:59.800
Maybe he hasn't woken up yet.

00:26:59.825 --> 00:27:00.854
Dad!

00:27:01.919 --> 00:27:03.234
Well, it's possible.

00:27:04.516 --> 00:27:05.403
Game over.

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:19.254
I'm not dreaming, am I?

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.053
I have to thank you.

00:28:29.277 --> 00:28:30.350
For what?

00:28:42.272 --> 00:28:43.409
The doctor said that

00:28:46.035 --> 00:28:47.410
if I had fallen then

00:28:48.083 --> 00:28:49.599
and hit my head on the ground,

00:28:53.295 --> 00:28:54.923
my condition would have been much worse.

00:28:58.235 --> 00:28:59.325
Oh.

00:29:00.324 --> 00:29:01.716
And the doctor also said

00:29:03.436 --> 00:29:04.856
that it was because before,

00:29:06.266 --> 00:29:07.777
I had been exercising

00:29:09.568 --> 00:29:10.968
and eating many good things.

00:29:13.666 --> 00:29:15.006
After the surgery,

00:29:16.223 --> 00:29:17.763
I recovered very quickly.

00:29:26.162 --> 00:29:27.860
Panting like this, are you okay?

00:29:31.392 --> 00:29:32.525
I'm fine.

00:29:33.791 --> 00:29:36.636
I'm so fit I could compete again.

00:29:41.076 --> 00:29:42.443
And why are you making this for me?

00:29:43.796 --> 00:29:45.624
So you can eat all your meals.

00:29:45.648 --> 00:29:46.904
So you won't faint again.

00:29:50.886 --> 00:29:52.518
You saved my life.

00:29:54.343 --> 00:29:55.283
Do you know that?

00:30:40.806 --> 00:30:41.946
Thank you.

00:31:04.298 --> 00:31:05.285
Nut.

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:07.252
You're feeling better now, right?

00:31:08.118 --> 00:31:09.291
Yes, Dad.

00:31:11.115 --> 00:31:13.042
Then you'll probably be able to

00:31:13.066 --> 00:31:14.274
get on a plane soon.

00:31:19.775 --> 00:31:20.818
Get on a plane?

00:31:21.758 --> 00:31:23.078
Where are we going, Dad?

00:31:23.673 --> 00:31:24.600
Well,

00:31:25.581 --> 00:31:28.323
to study a foundation course in England first.

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:31.050
And will you be going with him, Lin?

00:31:35.432 --> 00:31:37.740
I already have a foundation,

00:31:38.262 --> 00:31:40.489
I'll probably fly out when school starts.

00:31:44.178 --> 00:31:46.062
It's still many months before school starts.

00:31:46.205 --> 00:31:47.249
Isn't it too soon?

00:31:48.563 --> 00:31:49.545
Not at all.

00:31:49.569 --> 00:31:52.085
Nut's foundation isn't very good yet.

00:31:52.109 --> 00:31:54.178
So he should go and prepare beforehand.

00:31:57.023 --> 00:31:58.720
I don't want him to waste time

00:31:58.744 --> 00:32:00.232
on anything here anymore.

00:32:21.506 --> 00:32:22.694
I'm sorry.

00:32:28.108 --> 00:32:29.222
I didn't know

00:32:29.682 --> 00:32:31.357
that my dad would suddenly say that.

00:32:34.674 --> 00:32:35.749
It's okay.

00:32:37.619 --> 00:32:39.218
I think your dad is right.

00:32:39.885 --> 00:32:41.695
If you're really going to study in England,

00:32:41.719 --> 00:32:43.120
you need to take a foundation course.

00:32:49.276 --> 00:32:50.416
Honestly,

00:32:51.113 --> 00:32:53.155
he's just looking for an excuse
to stop me playing music.

00:33:01.863 --> 00:33:02.958
So,

00:33:04.485 --> 00:33:05.927
you really have to go, right?

00:33:08.562 --> 00:33:10.073
I can't argue with him.

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:13.743
I once made a deal with him that

00:33:15.432 --> 00:33:17.154
if I didn't win the competition,

00:33:19.902 --> 00:33:21.450
I would obey him in everything.

00:33:30.508 --> 00:33:31.663
And we

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:33.496
didn't win.

00:33:52.752 --> 00:33:54.374
I can't explain it.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.286
Lately, I haven't been able to sleep well.

00:33:59.359 --> 00:34:00.970
I just keep thinking about one person.

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:03.211
When I think about him,

00:34:03.825 --> 00:34:04.865
I feel pain.

00:34:05.578 --> 00:34:07.142
It's like my heart is breaking.

00:34:08.637 --> 00:34:10.900
The person you said you're thinking about,

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.977
is it Chai?

00:34:24.507 --> 00:34:25.725
Aek.

00:34:26.245 --> 00:34:27.480
I understand,

00:34:28.011 --> 00:34:29.566
what you're thinking.

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:32.021
And your mom and I are happy

00:34:32.794 --> 00:34:34.595
that you're willing to open up

00:34:34.619 --> 00:34:36.445
and talk to us about this.

00:34:39.523 --> 00:34:43.189
Did you and Mom already know?

00:34:45.297 --> 00:34:49.224
Actually, we both had some idea, right?

00:34:51.012 --> 00:34:53.394
But to be honest, at first,

00:34:54.007 --> 00:34:57.512
I was very worried about your safety.

00:34:59.549 --> 00:35:00.622
But now,

00:35:00.833 --> 00:35:02.768
your mom and I have been thinking that

00:35:02.792 --> 00:35:05.110
when you're not seeing Chai,

00:35:05.466 --> 00:35:06.823
I really feel that

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:10.811
it's hurting you a lot. I understand.

00:35:14.058 --> 00:35:17.020
So about seeing Chai,

00:35:17.482 --> 00:35:19.550
your mom and I won't stop you anymore.

00:35:22.577 --> 00:35:24.837
And about the promise you made that

00:35:25.259 --> 00:35:27.474
you would come back to use the rehearsal room

00:35:27.499 --> 00:35:31.804
and then stop seeing Chai after the competition,

00:35:31.828 --> 00:35:35.270
I think we should just forget about that.

00:35:36.192 --> 00:35:38.819
Yes, let's just forget about it, okay?

00:35:39.724 --> 00:35:40.860
Aek.

00:35:41.656 --> 00:35:43.071
I'm asking you,

00:35:43.938 --> 00:35:47.155
don't put yourself in a dangerous situation again.

00:35:47.321 --> 00:35:48.401
Okay, son?

00:35:49.017 --> 00:35:51.237
I promise, Dad, Mom.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.597
Aek.

00:35:59.517 --> 00:36:00.844
There's one more thing.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.952
I'll give you my bodyguard's number.

00:36:04.976 --> 00:36:06.092
Do you want it?

00:36:08.523 --> 00:36:09.746
You can eat now.

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:11.140
You're feeling better, right?

00:36:11.451 --> 00:36:13.217
Do you want my bodyguard's number?

00:36:15.264 --> 00:36:16.530
I'm serious.

00:36:39.023 --> 00:36:40.069
Hello, Chai.

00:36:40.093 --> 00:36:41.744
Do you want to get moo krata tomorrow?

00:36:42.808 --> 00:36:46.708
I'm not free tomorrow. I'm sorry.

00:36:54.881 --> 00:36:55.968
Come on.

00:36:58.389 --> 00:37:00.156
1...

00:37:02.502 --> 00:37:05.282
1, 2, 3.

00:37:09.152 --> 00:37:10.567
Waste of film.

00:37:10.679 --> 00:37:12.820
Can you make another face?

00:37:15.972 --> 00:37:17.580
I can't change the outcome, Biu.

00:37:20.295 --> 00:37:21.997
I think I tried my best.

00:37:27.071 --> 00:37:28.517
But the result is still the same.

00:37:57.237 --> 00:37:59.252
Even if Nut doesn't die in the end,

00:38:03.799 --> 00:38:05.356
I won't get to be with him.

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:10.070
I don't know what to say.

00:38:16.727 --> 00:38:17.973
Let's just say

00:38:19.188 --> 00:38:20.875
I'm here with you.

00:38:43.155 --> 00:38:44.554
Biu, is something wrong?

00:38:46.238 --> 00:38:49.900
When you have to be away from the one you love,

00:38:51.364 --> 00:38:53.867
just thinking about it hurts, doesn't it?

00:38:56.861 --> 00:38:57.873
Mmm.

00:38:58.473 --> 00:38:59.679
It must hurt a lot.

00:39:02.531 --> 00:39:04.638
Why did you invite me here?

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:06.941
Well, since the competition ended,

00:39:06.965 --> 00:39:08.469
I've been very lonely.

00:39:08.694 --> 00:39:10.009
I don't know what to do.

00:39:11.044 --> 00:39:13.319
And how's Nut?

00:39:14.323 --> 00:39:15.343
I heard that

00:39:16.216 --> 00:39:19.058
he has to take a foundation course.

00:39:19.252 --> 00:39:21.861
But he hasn't even finished school in Thailand.

00:39:22.172 --> 00:39:24.167
Can he just go and study like that?

00:39:25.036 --> 00:39:26.159
Yes.

00:39:26.371 --> 00:39:28.119
Because his dad let him take the equivalency exam.

00:39:28.786 --> 00:39:30.532
So Nut has to study hard lately.

00:39:31.322 --> 00:39:32.309
Mmm...

00:39:33.437 --> 00:39:35.124
Just listening to it makes me stressed for him.

00:39:37.654 --> 00:39:39.136
But don't worry, Biu.

00:39:39.461 --> 00:39:41.342
I'll be here until I finish 12th grade for sure.

00:39:42.162 --> 00:39:43.168
You won't be lonely.

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:45.238
What?

00:39:45.314 --> 00:39:47.242
Me, lonely? No way.

00:39:48.445 --> 00:39:50.345
Then should I just leave?

00:39:51.741 --> 00:39:52.790
No.

00:39:52.814 --> 00:39:54.034
I was just kidding.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.795
But actually, I don't want you to go, Lin.

00:40:00.794 --> 00:40:02.907
Can you not go?

00:40:05.398 --> 00:40:06.365
Okay.

00:40:07.111 --> 00:40:08.907
But you have to talk to my parents.

00:40:08.931 --> 00:40:11.949
Hey, how can I do that?

00:40:19.167 --> 00:40:20.167
Hello.

00:40:22.522 --> 00:40:23.589
What is it?

00:40:23.975 --> 00:40:25.322
Nut is studying.

00:40:29.744 --> 00:40:31.137
I just want to know, sir.

00:40:32.492 --> 00:40:34.374
Do you really want Nut to go to England,

00:40:35.027 --> 00:40:36.629
or do you just not want him to play music?

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:39.593
Why do you want to know?

00:40:41.522 --> 00:40:42.761
Don't you think

00:40:43.338 --> 00:40:44.938
that if Nut is far away,

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:46.905
he might secretly play music again?

00:40:48.795 --> 00:40:49.768
No way.

00:40:50.945 --> 00:40:52.594
I'm sending Nut to live with relatives.

00:40:53.087 --> 00:40:55.369
If he secretly plays again, I'll know anyway.

00:40:59.496 --> 00:41:00.869
Stop trying, Win.

00:41:02.624 --> 00:41:05.646
Letting him go to that useless music competition

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:06.951
was already enough.

00:41:11.754 --> 00:41:12.993
But you know, right?

00:41:14.579 --> 00:41:16.703
How torturous it is to live a life we didn't choose.

00:41:16.727 --> 00:41:17.927
It's just so painful.

00:41:19.976 --> 00:41:21.637
Weren't you a musician once?

00:41:24.586 --> 00:41:26.641
My life isn't torturous at all.

00:41:27.709 --> 00:41:29.146
And I still believe that

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:30.784
if I had chosen to be a musician back then,

00:41:31.754 --> 00:41:33.687
my life might have been more torturous.

00:41:34.855 --> 00:41:36.575
And I don't want Nut to be like that.

00:41:37.635 --> 00:41:39.919
Stuck in a useless dream

00:41:40.745 --> 00:41:42.014
that can't make a living.

00:41:46.148 --> 00:41:46.996
Then

00:41:47.416 --> 00:41:49.065
just let Nut stay in Thailand,

00:41:49.631 --> 00:41:51.279
but without playing music. Can't you?

00:41:53.454 --> 00:41:55.938
As long as you guys are around him,

00:41:56.572 --> 00:41:57.525
one day,

00:41:58.395 --> 00:42:00.377
you'll invite him to play again, right?

00:42:02.419 --> 00:42:04.007
Just like when you climbed into the house

00:42:04.031 --> 00:42:05.507
and secretly took Nut out.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:14.420
Let me teach you.

00:42:15.368 --> 00:42:17.677
As a friend of Nut's,

00:42:19.651 --> 00:42:20.598
give it up.

00:42:21.315 --> 00:42:22.968
The dream of being a musician.

00:42:24.008 --> 00:42:26.800
Go find something useful to do.

00:42:28.962 --> 00:42:32.459
Playing music is not a viable profession.

00:43:24.537 --> 00:43:26.010
Here, Tim, an omelet.

00:43:30.173 --> 00:43:32.452
Here, this.

00:43:33.989 --> 00:43:34.744
Dad.

00:43:34.768 --> 00:43:35.635
What?

00:43:36.062 --> 00:43:38.088
Do you think I should go study in England?

00:43:39.179 --> 00:43:40.319
Good.

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.200
But wait for me to make money first.

00:43:44.188 --> 00:43:45.535
You're just joking.

00:43:45.902 --> 00:43:47.590
Where are we going to get the money from?

00:43:49.209 --> 00:43:52.386
If you want to go, I can find it.

00:43:54.624 --> 00:43:56.225
You're going to borrow from someone else.

00:43:56.249 --> 00:43:57.883
Oh, you figured it out.

00:43:59.173 --> 00:44:00.977
Who am I going to borrow from, an angel?

00:44:01.001 --> 00:44:03.540
You have to earn it with your own sweat.

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:08.017
Hey, Win!

00:44:08.513 --> 00:44:09.600
Hey, Win!

00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:11.555
Win, Win, Win!

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:12.566
What's wrong with you?

00:44:12.591 --> 00:44:13.727
Reading this.

00:44:17.814 --> 00:44:19.862
Our band is so cool.

00:44:21.579 --> 00:44:23.089
Hey, where are you going?

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.410
This house is full of surprises.

00:44:29.434 --> 00:44:31.476
They come and go as they please.

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:32.734
There's always something exciting.

00:44:44.045 --> 00:44:45.051
Nut!

00:44:46.012 --> 00:44:47.006
Nut!

00:44:49.256 --> 00:44:50.256
Nut!

00:44:53.048 --> 00:44:54.242
Nut!

00:45:10.322 --> 00:45:11.259
Win.

00:45:21.202 --> 00:45:22.050
You're going to England

00:45:22.074 --> 00:45:23.322
and not even going to say goodbye?

00:45:24.264 --> 00:45:26.559
England? What are you talking about?

00:45:26.583 --> 00:45:28.041
I still have a lot to prepare.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:30.740
Oh.

00:45:31.513 --> 00:45:32.335
Well,

00:45:33.562 --> 00:45:36.269
I saw you putting your suitcase in the car.

00:45:37.259 --> 00:45:38.180
The suitcase wheel is broken,

00:45:38.204 --> 00:45:39.260
so I'm taking it to get fixed.

00:45:40.773 --> 00:45:41.866
So what's up?

00:46:00.792 --> 00:46:02.192
Damn!

00:46:03.415 --> 00:46:04.923
We're going to release a tape!

00:46:06.034 --> 00:46:07.581
Shit, we're releasing a tape.

00:46:12.628 --> 00:46:13.654
Really?

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.540
The label contacted us.

00:46:55.241 --> 00:46:57.293
(Next Episode)
Have you guys heard from the producer yet?

00:46:57.324 --> 00:46:59.232
We're going to have a concert.

00:46:59.534 --> 00:47:01.724
I never thought a small band could come this far.

00:47:01.748 --> 00:47:03.477
I'm so happy.

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:05.404
You're not free to celebrate with friends,

00:47:05.643 --> 00:47:07.530
but you're here, just the two of us like this.

00:47:08.158 --> 00:47:09.505
I can't think of anything good.

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:14.653
Chai, I...

00:47:14.677 --> 00:47:15.805
Hey, I'm going home now.

00:47:17.169 --> 00:47:18.848
Hurry up and clear it up.

00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:22.070
I told you not to buy it.

00:47:22.149 --> 00:47:25.158
Don't compare my work with what you do.
