00:00:02.102 --> 00:00:03.802
(Episode 17)

00:00:07.672 --> 00:00:08.842
You're out already?

00:00:13.282 --> 00:00:14.282
Ready to go?

00:00:15.212 --> 00:00:16.212
Yes.

00:00:23.752 --> 00:00:25.922
We can get our blood work done together, right?

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:27.192
Yes.

00:00:28.222 --> 00:00:29.232
I'm nervous.

00:00:30.092 --> 00:00:32.962
Hospitals always make me nervous for some reason.

00:00:37.272 --> 00:00:38.272
Same here.

00:00:44.142 --> 00:00:45.842
(Ji Eun Oh)

00:00:52.622 --> 00:00:54.352
So you get scared easily too, Ms. Ji.

00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:57.352
I can't stand the sight of blood.

00:01:01.462 --> 00:01:02.632
Apply pressure, please.

00:01:04.292 --> 00:01:06.162
(Ko Seong Hui, Ji Eun Oh)

00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:08.132
(Ko Seong Hui, Ji Eun Oh)

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:09.672
(Cafe Agit)

00:01:13.642 --> 00:01:15.572
Hey, why are you moving all your stuff out?

00:01:15.912 --> 00:01:16.912
Are you moving out?

00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:19.642
Sorry I couldn't tell you sooner.

00:01:19.642 --> 00:01:21.442
It was suddenly decided late last night.

00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:23.452
A new employee is starting today.

00:01:24.052 --> 00:01:25.052
All right.

00:01:26.022 --> 00:01:27.122
Gyeong Su, say hi.

00:01:28.022 --> 00:01:31.092
He's a friend from volunteer work back in my freshman year of college.

00:01:32.662 --> 00:01:34.522
He's been working in interior design,

00:01:34.522 --> 00:01:36.132
and he's starting with us today.

00:01:36.232 --> 00:01:38.092
I'm Oh Su Jeong. Nice to meet you.

00:01:38.092 --> 00:01:39.162
We were in the same club back in university.

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:41.932
From the club. I see. I'm Jo Gyeong Su.

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:44.432
He's the team lead for Mamdaerozip and turnkey projects.

00:01:44.932 --> 00:01:47.902
Ji Hyuk is giving me some big titles right off the bat.

00:01:48.342 --> 00:01:49.612
- Get moving. - Right.

00:01:49.672 --> 00:01:50.672
Oh, boy.

00:01:51.512 --> 00:01:53.282
I'll make sure to wrap things up before the cafe opens.

00:01:53.542 --> 00:01:54.542
Okay.

00:02:05.362 --> 00:02:07.362
(Radiation Area, Restricted Area, Authorized Personnel Only)

00:02:12.802 --> 00:02:14.762
There are so many tests.

00:02:16.032 --> 00:02:18.272
It's the comprehensive checkup my husband and I get.

00:02:18.572 --> 00:02:21.042
For early detection of any potential issues.

00:02:22.372 --> 00:02:23.372
I see.

00:02:23.512 --> 00:02:26.412
Oh, right. For the MRI, the contrast agent...

00:02:26.482 --> 00:02:28.782
might make you feel cold, so don't be alarmed.

00:02:29.912 --> 00:02:30.912
Okay.

00:02:41.522 --> 00:02:43.832
(Hyunmyeong Apartments Construction Status)

00:03:24.132 --> 00:03:27.202
If you're doing business together, I imagine there's a reason.

00:03:28.372 --> 00:03:29.372
Yes.

00:03:29.812 --> 00:03:32.482
I want to make money and repay her.

00:03:32.882 --> 00:03:33.882
My mom.

00:03:34.682 --> 00:03:37.912
And as for Gang Oh, I think he's worried about his future.

00:03:38.822 --> 00:03:42.122
Then, congratulations are in order. Congratulations.

00:03:43.092 --> 00:03:45.722
- Pardon? - For choosing for yourself, Eun Oh.

00:03:48.122 --> 00:03:51.902
When your mind is a mess, staying busy is the best thing.

00:03:52.132 --> 00:03:53.862
It keeps your mind from wandering.

00:03:55.502 --> 00:03:56.502
That's true.

00:03:56.832 --> 00:03:57.902
It really is.

00:03:59.602 --> 00:04:00.602
But...

00:04:01.402 --> 00:04:03.872
Do you think you could take on my project as well?

00:04:04.772 --> 00:04:06.482
I've already chosen the artists.

00:04:08.712 --> 00:04:09.882
You have?

00:04:10.952 --> 00:04:14.782
Yes, three. A stationery designer, an illustrator, and a ceramicist.

00:04:15.522 --> 00:04:18.122
A ceramicist will need a kiln, though.

00:04:18.562 --> 00:04:20.292
The artist is fine with using an off-site kiln.

00:04:20.922 --> 00:04:24.892
So now, I need you to start the design work.

00:04:26.862 --> 00:04:28.702
Yes, will do.

00:04:29.232 --> 00:04:30.602
(Cafe Entrance)

00:04:32.302 --> 00:04:34.102
I'm sorry I can't give you a ride.

00:04:34.872 --> 00:04:38.042
Not at all. I even got a checkup, thanks to you.

00:04:38.882 --> 00:04:39.882
Here you go.

00:04:41.312 --> 00:04:42.582
One's for me.

00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:45.222
This is for you and your business partner,

00:04:45.222 --> 00:04:46.722
and this one's for your mom.

00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:48.822
A thank-you gift for coming with me to the checkup today.

00:04:50.152 --> 00:04:53.722
No, really. This is too much, Director Ko.

00:04:54.622 --> 00:04:56.892
You really keep me at arm's length, don't you, Eun Oh?

00:04:57.332 --> 00:05:00.162
I'll be hurt if you react like this over just a simple dessert.

00:05:00.702 --> 00:05:02.232
But it's not just this.

00:05:03.532 --> 00:05:04.632
Well, actually...

00:05:05.402 --> 00:05:07.642
About the glass sculpture you bought for me last time...

00:05:07.772 --> 00:05:11.512
Don't even bring that up. I told you I dreamt it shattered.

00:05:12.082 --> 00:05:14.282
Give it away, or just throw it out.

00:05:15.912 --> 00:05:16.912
See you.

00:05:17.682 --> 00:05:19.482
Okay. Get home safe.

00:05:35.872 --> 00:05:37.332
She's too nice to me.

00:05:38.972 --> 00:05:41.402
But why a gift every single time we meet?

00:05:47.642 --> 00:05:49.152
Now, we wait.

00:05:55.022 --> 00:05:56.022
I'm back, Su Jeong.

00:05:56.092 --> 00:05:58.492
You're back? How did your health screening go?

00:05:58.552 --> 00:05:59.562
How was it?

00:05:59.622 --> 00:06:02.732
It was the full VIP checkup. I got a CT scan, an MRI...

00:06:02.792 --> 00:06:04.692
They ran every test in the book.

00:06:04.692 --> 00:06:07.002
They could probably find a pimple on my liver.

00:06:07.062 --> 00:06:10.872
Really? I can't wait to see what they find.

00:06:11.802 --> 00:06:12.802
What's this?

00:06:14.302 --> 00:06:17.012
She bought these for us to share. There's some for my mom too.

00:06:17.512 --> 00:06:18.512
She did?

00:06:19.042 --> 00:06:21.342
Hey, she must really like you.

00:06:22.182 --> 00:06:25.622
I know, right? Why would someone like her like me?

00:06:26.322 --> 00:06:27.952
(Oh Su Jeong)

00:06:35.362 --> 00:06:38.962
Ji Hyuk moved his office. He moved out before we opened.

00:06:39.602 --> 00:06:43.502
He moved offices without telling me? He didn't say a word yesterday.

00:06:43.872 --> 00:06:48.272
The new team leader starts today. It was a sudden decision last night.

00:06:49.212 --> 00:06:51.442
What? How could he do that? I'm his partner.

00:06:51.872 --> 00:06:54.142
He could've at least sent a text or said a proper goodbye.

00:06:55.782 --> 00:06:57.382
Wait a minute, then...

00:06:57.982 --> 00:07:00.752
What about the turnkey meeting? Am I supposed to go there?

00:07:00.822 --> 00:07:02.322
Or is he planning on coming here?

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:04.492
He has no manners.

00:07:05.462 --> 00:07:06.862
Well, it's just around the corner.

00:07:08.022 --> 00:07:10.862
Eun Oh, let's take this...

00:07:11.162 --> 00:07:12.962
and go visit his new office, shall we?

00:07:13.402 --> 00:07:15.102
Come on, aren't you curious what kind of place he got?

00:07:15.432 --> 00:07:17.072
Why bother with someone who left without so much as a goodbye?

00:07:32.582 --> 00:07:34.482
You really feel their absence when they're gone.

00:07:35.382 --> 00:07:36.622
It feels so empty.

00:07:37.292 --> 00:07:38.292
Right?

00:07:40.022 --> 00:07:42.132
Well, I guess now I can...

00:07:42.192 --> 00:07:44.232
finally pull all-nighters in peace.

00:07:45.092 --> 00:07:47.002
Eun Oh, you should use this, then.

00:07:47.102 --> 00:07:48.802
He has no room for it in his new office.

00:07:53.572 --> 00:07:54.872
Why would I use this?

00:07:56.012 --> 00:07:58.912
He waltzes in here and then leaves without a word.

00:08:00.842 --> 00:08:02.312
He's such a weirdo.

00:08:03.112 --> 00:08:05.282
If you're not careful getting up from your chair,

00:08:05.582 --> 00:08:06.952
you might end up kissing someone.

00:08:08.082 --> 00:08:10.492
You've turned into a cheesy old man, Gyeong Su.

00:08:10.792 --> 00:08:12.052
That was a thinly veiled jab.

00:08:12.292 --> 00:08:15.162
All right, both of you take a seat. Let's get this meeting started.

00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:17.332
On our first day here?

00:08:18.062 --> 00:08:19.402
It's already 5pm.

00:08:19.702 --> 00:08:22.702
You've been working from home, so let's check in, then get dinner.

00:08:22.772 --> 00:08:23.972
We're done here for the day.

00:08:24.132 --> 00:08:28.172
My gosh. So, this is what it means to be a CEO?

00:08:29.242 --> 00:08:30.812
With Ohyang Apartments' extra request,

00:08:30.812 --> 00:08:32.812
we've confirmed dates for 15 homes.

00:08:33.282 --> 00:08:35.552
You're in the Hyunmyeong group chat,

00:08:35.552 --> 00:08:37.612
and on the turnkey job, our designers...

00:08:37.682 --> 00:08:39.552
have begun working on the blueprints with the client.

00:08:40.982 --> 00:08:43.422
Having them upload photos every day was a stroke of genius.

00:08:46.922 --> 00:08:48.662
(Suri-dong Hanok House Turnkey Interior Design Project)

00:08:53.532 --> 00:08:56.002
Are you still agonizing over the Suri-dong estimate?

00:08:56.602 --> 00:08:58.672
I can't have you wasting time on a lost cause.

00:08:59.242 --> 00:09:02.812
I can only tell if it'll work or not by spending more time on it,

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:04.242
Mr. Lee.

00:09:06.442 --> 00:09:08.182
- Gyeong Su. - Yes.

00:09:08.852 --> 00:09:11.582
- Hello. - My gosh.

00:09:11.582 --> 00:09:14.752
I'm Jo Gyeong Su, the new team leader at Mamdaerozip.

00:09:17.022 --> 00:09:18.992
I'm Ji Eun Oh. I'm handling the turnkey projects.

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:20.522
I look forward to working with you.

00:09:20.992 --> 00:09:21.992
Likewise.

00:09:23.532 --> 00:09:26.132
We're heading out for a team dinner to celebrate the move.

00:09:26.462 --> 00:09:27.462
Would you like to join us?

00:09:28.232 --> 00:09:32.202
I'm sorry. I have urgent work to finish today.

00:09:33.402 --> 00:09:35.712
If someone had told me today was moving day,

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:37.872
I would have kept my schedule open.

00:09:40.042 --> 00:09:43.252
- You didn't tell her? - I'll contact you, Mr. Jo.

00:09:43.352 --> 00:09:46.182
Well, all right. Since you two are on the same team,

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:48.252
you can just get in touch later.

00:09:48.992 --> 00:09:50.022
Let's go, man.

00:09:55.322 --> 00:09:58.132
Great. Strictly business.

00:10:01.132 --> 00:10:03.232
Really? Sin Yeong!

00:10:03.472 --> 00:10:06.302
Sang Cheol passed his written exam. I'm just having one drink, okay?

00:10:06.372 --> 00:10:09.012
My gosh. That is amazing.

00:10:09.072 --> 00:10:13.082
I'm impressed, Lee Sang Cheol! Congratulations!

00:10:13.412 --> 00:10:14.712
Make it three drinks, tops.

00:10:14.712 --> 00:10:16.012
We're expecting many customers today.

00:10:16.082 --> 00:10:18.552
This is wonderful. Oh, I left the stove on.

00:10:18.612 --> 00:10:20.952
- Thanks, Sin Yeong. - I love you!

00:10:21.422 --> 00:10:26.322
- Man, you really married well. - We're soulmates, you know.

00:10:26.422 --> 00:10:27.762
That's why we have it so good.

00:10:29.132 --> 00:10:30.392
Hey, I bet your wife is thrilled.

00:10:30.762 --> 00:10:34.432
She must've been a nervous wreck, wondering if you'd pull it off.

00:10:34.962 --> 00:10:36.132
I didn't tell her.

00:10:37.032 --> 00:10:39.002
You didn't? Why not?

00:10:39.602 --> 00:10:44.012
I didn't want to make a big fuss in front of Ji Hyuk.

00:10:44.472 --> 00:10:46.912
The exam was the day after Ji Hyuk came home.

00:10:46.982 --> 00:10:48.282
Ji Hyuk is back?

00:10:48.782 --> 00:10:49.912
No way. How?

00:10:50.482 --> 00:10:53.722
But still, you didn't even tell her you passed?

00:10:53.782 --> 00:10:56.792
Passing the electrician's exam is no joke.

00:10:56.852 --> 00:11:00.722
Tell me about it. Man, I thought I was going to cry.

00:11:08.532 --> 00:11:11.432
(Score: 69, Pass)

00:11:11.502 --> 00:11:13.302
(Examinee: Lee Sang Cheol)

00:11:23.382 --> 00:11:24.452
Sir.

00:11:25.012 --> 00:11:27.152
It's all right. You can always take it again.

00:11:27.522 --> 00:11:30.392
This was my 2nd time, and I got a 54.

00:11:30.992 --> 00:11:31.992
Excuse me?

00:11:33.222 --> 00:11:36.362
I passed. I got a 69.

00:11:36.432 --> 00:11:37.432
What?

00:11:39.332 --> 00:11:41.902
A 69? My gosh. Congratulations, man.

00:11:41.962 --> 00:11:43.032
Yes. Thank you.

00:11:43.032 --> 00:11:46.502
Congratulations. The pass rate is only 30 percent. You did it.

00:11:46.642 --> 00:11:49.342
This is actually the first time I've taken the written exam.

00:11:50.012 --> 00:11:54.012
Hey. Am I amazing or what? I passed on my first try.

00:11:54.312 --> 00:11:57.182
I wanted to run right home and tell my wife.

00:11:57.782 --> 00:12:02.422
Yes, you were really stressed out. I am so proud of you.

00:12:02.492 --> 00:12:04.492
Oh, man...

00:12:05.052 --> 00:12:06.992
But I still can't believe you didn't tell her.

00:12:07.262 --> 00:12:10.092
You hid the exam date, saying you'd tell her after passing.

00:12:10.592 --> 00:12:14.262
I told you. Ji Hyuk showed up the day before the exam.

00:12:14.962 --> 00:12:16.832
And you know what he said when he walked in?

00:12:18.132 --> 00:12:19.872
It was time for me to come home.

00:12:20.272 --> 00:12:23.212
Doesn't Mom own half of this house?

00:12:23.712 --> 00:12:27.382
You don't think this house is yours just because you paid, do you?

00:12:28.412 --> 00:12:33.052
He came in so high and mighty, and I let him get to me.

00:12:33.352 --> 00:12:34.422
I see.

00:12:34.782 --> 00:12:37.092
You couldn't tell him to leave again, could you?

00:12:37.392 --> 00:12:39.322
You couldn't say, "Who let you back in?"

00:12:39.962 --> 00:12:41.922
And he's not wrong about his mom's half.

00:12:42.222 --> 00:12:44.832
Right, but he acts so nonchalant about it,

00:12:44.962 --> 00:12:47.532
so why am I the one feeling awkward in my own house?

00:12:48.532 --> 00:12:49.902
Anyway,

00:12:50.332 --> 00:12:52.372
what's Ji Hyuk been up to all this time?

00:12:52.902 --> 00:12:54.442
I didn't even ask.

00:12:55.102 --> 00:12:57.172
He won't even say what he's doing now,

00:12:57.172 --> 00:12:58.512
let alone what he's been up to.

00:12:58.742 --> 00:12:59.942
What he's doing now?

00:13:01.142 --> 00:13:03.452
Apparently, he's running a business...

00:13:03.452 --> 00:13:05.712
and said to wait until he fills us in.

00:13:05.982 --> 00:13:08.352
My gosh, Ji Hyuk has really changed...

00:13:10.492 --> 00:13:12.822
Are you intimidated now he's running his own business?

00:13:13.592 --> 00:13:14.992
You still need to pass your practical exam...

00:13:14.992 --> 00:13:16.032
and then find a job.

00:13:16.292 --> 00:13:17.792
You're still in limbo.

00:13:19.462 --> 00:13:22.502
You're right. I didn't want him to see me like this.

00:13:23.232 --> 00:13:26.372
I don't know how the world changed so much,

00:13:26.742 --> 00:13:29.872
but that kid thinks his marriage was just some mistake,

00:13:30.012 --> 00:13:34.212
and he thinks he can come and go whenever he pleases.

00:13:34.612 --> 00:13:35.912
But I can't kick him out.

00:13:36.352 --> 00:13:38.512
Because of my wife and my mother.

00:13:39.682 --> 00:13:41.282
You're his parent, after all.

00:13:41.882 --> 00:13:45.222
And he probably came back because he needs a place to stay.

00:13:46.322 --> 00:13:49.292
I can't just kick my own son out when he came back on his own,

00:13:49.932 --> 00:13:53.502
but man, I'm still upset. He still...

00:13:53.632 --> 00:13:58.402
blames me for it. He says he did it because of his incompetent father.

00:13:58.772 --> 00:14:00.402
And with Ji Hyuk being so brazen about it,

00:14:00.672 --> 00:14:02.442
I don't know how I'm supposed to deal with him.

00:14:03.542 --> 00:14:05.712
My oldest is a junior in high school,

00:14:05.712 --> 00:14:06.982
but he can be like that too.

00:14:08.082 --> 00:14:11.252
He'll ask, "Dad, why didn't you stay at the brokerage firm?"

00:14:12.752 --> 00:14:15.222
Every time he asks me that, my heart just sinks.

00:14:15.922 --> 00:14:18.622
Because I feel like I know why he's asking.

00:14:20.162 --> 00:14:21.192
Parents...

00:14:21.922 --> 00:14:24.662
You're only a parent when your kids accept you as one.

00:14:24.892 --> 00:14:28.262
It's not a title you can just claim for yourself.

00:14:40.612 --> 00:14:42.582
I really want this.

00:15:03.332 --> 00:15:04.672
Who put this up?

00:15:05.872 --> 00:15:06.872
Min Woo?

00:15:48.982 --> 00:15:52.512
(Jung Hyeon Su Architecture Lab)

00:16:11.802 --> 00:16:14.342
- It won't spike your blood sugar. - Really?

00:16:21.012 --> 00:16:23.212
I want to get Seong Jae some herbal medicine too.

00:16:23.212 --> 00:16:25.552
Would he have time to visit the clinic with me?

00:16:26.122 --> 00:16:30.692
He's been getting home very late, and it's weird to ask him about it.

00:16:31.752 --> 00:16:33.422
You don't need to worry about Seong Jae.

00:16:34.492 --> 00:16:36.192
Let's just get our checkups.

00:16:36.592 --> 00:16:38.032
Hasn't it been over a year?

00:16:38.932 --> 00:16:42.832
Give your schedule to my secretary. I'll have them book it.

00:16:43.172 --> 00:16:45.672
I'll just get a colonoscopy this time.

00:16:45.972 --> 00:16:50.442
My tests were all clear last year. Do I really need to do it all again?

00:16:50.712 --> 00:16:51.872
It's a waste of money.

00:16:52.442 --> 00:16:55.012
Your liver. We need to check your liver.

00:16:55.312 --> 00:16:56.952
I'm telling you, you don't look so well.

00:16:57.712 --> 00:16:59.452
You should get yours first this year.

00:16:59.622 --> 00:17:01.982
I'll get mine after Yeong Ra's exhibition is done.

00:17:03.722 --> 00:17:07.362
Oh, my goodness. What is all this?

00:17:08.022 --> 00:17:11.962
The checkup was more than enough, but she even got something for me.

00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:15.132
Apparently, that place is famous for its desserts.

00:17:15.662 --> 00:17:16.672
Really?

00:17:17.232 --> 00:17:19.572
Then, let's have some tonight.

00:17:20.542 --> 00:17:23.642
My stomach's still a little upset. You go ahead.

00:17:23.712 --> 00:17:25.072
Besides, I still have some work to do.

00:17:27.282 --> 00:17:28.742
Director Ko, was it?

00:17:29.952 --> 00:17:33.652
Thank Director Ko for me. I'll definitely enjoy these.

00:17:34.752 --> 00:17:35.752
Sure.

00:17:41.192 --> 00:17:42.192
I was right.

00:17:44.062 --> 00:17:45.432
That's exactly what she's doing.

00:17:51.772 --> 00:17:54.272
I don't know

00:17:56.312 --> 00:17:58.512
I have no idea

00:17:59.682 --> 00:18:03.612
Where my own son is or what he's doing

00:18:04.552 --> 00:18:07.582
I have no idea

00:18:15.962 --> 00:18:16.962
Hey, you.

00:18:17.232 --> 00:18:19.262
If you're going to greet me, do it properly.

00:18:19.702 --> 00:18:21.332
Can't you say, "Hello, how was your day?"

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:25.832
Dad, you're home? Hey, you're just getting in too?

00:18:28.072 --> 00:18:29.072
I'm going to my room.

00:18:30.042 --> 00:18:32.642
Hey, you call yourself a businessman?

00:18:32.642 --> 00:18:34.212
What's with those clothes?

00:18:34.412 --> 00:18:36.852
Who's going to give you business dressed like that?

00:18:37.782 --> 00:18:39.152
Dressing like this is fine.

00:18:39.422 --> 00:18:41.682
- I can handle it myself. - Handle it yourself?

00:18:42.152 --> 00:18:46.292
Right. The "I can handle it" guy gets dumped on his wedding day?

00:18:50.362 --> 00:18:51.562
How long will you bring that up?

00:18:52.032 --> 00:18:54.502
What do you mean, how long?

00:18:54.662 --> 00:18:57.272
Hey, when did you come back after leaving that day?

00:18:57.632 --> 00:19:01.102
Did I say a word since you got back? What do you mean, "how long?"

00:19:01.572 --> 00:19:04.412
It's just that it seems like you haven't let it go, Dad.

00:19:05.242 --> 00:19:06.712
You expect me not to hold onto it?

00:19:07.182 --> 00:19:08.542
Is it supposed to just disappear into thin air?

00:19:09.182 --> 00:19:10.712
Are you really that optimistic?

00:19:11.382 --> 00:19:12.382
Yes.

00:19:13.082 --> 00:19:15.652
If it were me, I'd consider it water under the bridge.

00:19:16.122 --> 00:19:18.322
But if you can't, there's nothing to be done.

00:19:19.962 --> 00:19:22.322
Get some rest. I'm tired too. I'd like to go wash up.

00:19:29.302 --> 00:19:30.732
Darn it.

00:19:31.172 --> 00:19:32.702
Did you want to use the bathroom first?

00:19:35.242 --> 00:19:37.042
Are you trying to pick a fight with me right now?

00:19:38.112 --> 00:19:39.242
Pick a fight?

00:19:39.782 --> 00:19:40.912
This kid, I swear.

00:19:42.042 --> 00:19:44.812
Hey, what are you two doing? Mother is sleeping.

00:19:45.282 --> 00:19:48.082
He's the one who keeps pushing my buttons.

00:19:49.652 --> 00:19:50.922
Have you been drinking again?

00:19:51.792 --> 00:19:53.492
I thought you said you were studying for your exam.

00:19:54.122 --> 00:19:57.492
Honey. Actually, a few days ago...

00:19:57.632 --> 00:19:59.132
It's not like he's some student cramming for exams.

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:01.702
Do you expect him to just study and never have a drink?

00:20:05.172 --> 00:20:07.802
Still, you need to know when to stop.

00:20:09.842 --> 00:20:11.142
All right, forget it.

00:20:28.362 --> 00:20:30.692
Honey, Ji Hyuk, breakfast is ready.

00:20:32.292 --> 00:20:33.302
Okay.

00:20:34.602 --> 00:20:35.662
I'm not hungry.

00:20:36.602 --> 00:20:37.602
Honey.

00:20:38.502 --> 00:20:40.802
How long will you keep this up with Ji Hyuk?

00:20:42.912 --> 00:20:45.812
I have an early special lecture.

00:20:50.312 --> 00:20:53.282
Darn. Who needs a wife and family anyway?

00:20:56.692 --> 00:20:58.052
(Owa Fire and Electrical Training Academy)

00:20:58.122 --> 00:21:00.792
First off, congratulations on passing the written exam.

00:21:04.292 --> 00:21:05.792
Some of you may have missed the exam...

00:21:05.792 --> 00:21:08.362
and are here preparing for the practicals.

00:21:08.932 --> 00:21:10.532
But most of you have passed, correct?

00:21:10.732 --> 00:21:11.772
- Yes. - Yes.

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:14.442
Did anyone here pass on the first try?

00:21:14.972 --> 00:21:15.972
I did.

00:21:17.612 --> 00:21:19.242
Congratulations.

00:21:25.182 --> 00:21:26.212
My gosh.

00:21:26.822 --> 00:21:28.552
Ms. Ji, Here.

00:21:31.452 --> 00:21:32.622
Keep the whistle around your neck,

00:21:32.922 --> 00:21:34.822
put the pepper spray in your pocket,

00:21:35.422 --> 00:21:37.732
and keep the taser in the front pocket of your bag.

00:21:38.392 --> 00:21:40.002
Why are you giving me all this?

00:21:40.202 --> 00:21:42.132
Because the walk from the bus stop to your place is dark.

00:21:42.632 --> 00:21:44.172
You're always out late.

00:21:45.902 --> 00:21:49.572
As your partner, it's a precaution so my business doesn't suffer.

00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:52.942
Come on. I know how to take care of myself.

00:21:53.012 --> 00:21:55.782
No, they still haven't caught that mugger.

00:21:57.412 --> 00:21:58.782
Wait, what mugger?

00:22:01.222 --> 00:22:02.452
What are you talking about?

00:22:03.722 --> 00:22:05.192
Eun Oh, were you mugged?

00:22:07.622 --> 00:22:10.262
No. I'm telling you. I'm perfectly fine.

00:22:10.432 --> 00:22:11.832
Well, I'm not.

00:22:12.692 --> 00:22:14.202
- What? - I know...

00:22:14.202 --> 00:22:16.932
your streets are empty at night, and you always take the last bus.

00:22:17.502 --> 00:22:19.902
I even know this cafe was robbed, and you expect me to do nothing?

00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:22.342
What if something were to happen?

00:22:23.172 --> 00:22:26.142
How do you think I'd feel? I'd be riddled with guilt.

00:22:27.182 --> 00:22:31.082
So this is for your sake,

00:22:31.252 --> 00:22:32.782
but it's for my sake too.

00:22:35.082 --> 00:22:37.522
- But every day? - I know, right? Every day.

00:22:37.592 --> 00:22:40.122
What's the big deal about me driving her home?

00:22:41.462 --> 00:22:43.092
I work late every night anyway.

00:22:43.392 --> 00:22:44.462
From now on,

00:22:45.132 --> 00:22:47.702
on days you go home after 10pm, I'll be the one to take you.

00:22:48.232 --> 00:22:51.872
Eun Oh, if you don't call me, I'll wait for you here all night.

00:22:57.212 --> 00:22:58.242
Then...

00:22:58.712 --> 00:23:00.582
only when it's after 10pm.

00:23:03.082 --> 00:23:04.112
I'll get you a coffee.

00:23:10.952 --> 00:23:12.922
Park Seong Jae, aren't you going a little overboard?

00:23:13.422 --> 00:23:15.962
Hey, isn't Eun Oh's safety what's most important?

00:23:16.692 --> 00:23:19.592
And didn't you get her that gear,

00:23:19.592 --> 00:23:21.332
knowing she wouldn't get in your car?

00:23:24.302 --> 00:23:25.302
Fine.

00:23:25.932 --> 00:23:27.272
Take good care of my business partner.

00:23:45.492 --> 00:23:47.292
This one's a little too traditional.

00:23:47.722 --> 00:23:49.662
It needs to be elegant, with a touch of charm.

00:23:50.492 --> 00:23:51.492
Go try on something else.

00:23:53.402 --> 00:23:54.402
Okay.

00:24:06.142 --> 00:24:08.082
You bought a lot of clothes all at once.

00:24:08.842 --> 00:24:10.652
All these clothes just for one date?

00:24:13.282 --> 00:24:16.322
I wanted to ask you something first.

00:24:17.822 --> 00:24:20.222
I told you So Ri and Chan went out to find food,

00:24:20.222 --> 00:24:22.492
but then it rained and they got lost.

00:24:23.132 --> 00:24:26.392
But they're being chased by bounty hunters after So Ri.

00:24:27.702 --> 00:24:28.902
Night falls.

00:24:30.072 --> 00:24:33.172
They need a place to hide. Where do you think they should go?

00:24:33.702 --> 00:24:35.672
Not a supermarket or some empty house.

00:24:38.472 --> 00:24:39.542
A car?

00:24:40.212 --> 00:24:43.382
An empty house is too cliche. It's their first night together.

00:24:43.652 --> 00:24:44.812
Right, exactly.

00:24:45.412 --> 00:24:48.822
- That's where the romance begins. - Well...

00:24:49.952 --> 00:24:51.652
A comic book shop! Hey, that's perfect!

00:24:53.262 --> 00:24:55.192
I've seen one. One of those cafe-style places.

00:24:55.292 --> 00:24:57.592
No, not those new ones.

00:24:57.592 --> 00:24:59.362
A classic comic shop would be better.

00:24:59.492 --> 00:25:02.602
That retro vibe is a perfect match for the zombie apocalypse aesthetic.

00:25:04.272 --> 00:25:05.832
Describe it to me.

00:25:06.702 --> 00:25:09.272
Well, you really have to go there to get the feel for it.

00:25:10.012 --> 00:25:11.242
Let's go do some field research.

00:25:12.842 --> 00:25:14.312
How am I supposed to go?

00:25:15.482 --> 00:25:16.612
You know I can't.

00:25:17.882 --> 00:25:20.882
Didn't you say Ms. Jang was going out for lunch?

00:25:31.932 --> 00:25:33.032
I'm going out for lunch.

00:25:33.402 --> 00:25:34.402
Okay, see you later.

00:25:48.442 --> 00:25:50.552
In one minute. Leave your phone and come on out.

00:25:56.252 --> 00:25:57.752
(Comics)

00:25:57.892 --> 00:25:59.092
Ji Wan, wait a second.

00:25:59.552 --> 00:26:03.232
Come on, if your phone and car are in front of the studio,

00:26:03.332 --> 00:26:05.932
there's no way your mother will suspect a thing.

00:26:07.402 --> 00:26:09.402
But what if Mom calls?

00:26:11.502 --> 00:26:12.502
Welcome.

00:26:13.642 --> 00:26:14.642
Here we are.

00:26:18.672 --> 00:26:19.672
Oh, my.

00:26:20.382 --> 00:26:22.442
Hey, it's hard to find a comic shop like this these days.

00:26:22.912 --> 00:26:23.982
Quick, start sketching!

00:26:26.412 --> 00:26:28.052
Hey.

00:26:28.922 --> 00:26:29.922
Hey.

00:26:48.372 --> 00:26:50.572
Right. So Ri and Chan would read comics...

00:26:50.572 --> 00:26:51.772
to stay up all night.

00:26:53.712 --> 00:26:55.082
Where should we sit?

00:27:08.922 --> 00:27:09.992
Hey, Park Yeong Ra.

00:27:09.992 --> 00:27:11.762
Are you seriously reading comics right now?

00:27:12.162 --> 00:27:13.532
Are you done sketching?

00:27:14.232 --> 00:27:15.232
Hey...

00:27:20.342 --> 00:27:24.312
Ms. Jang gets back at 1:10pm. It's 12:35pm now.

00:27:24.442 --> 00:27:27.442
Look, I even booked a deluxe taxi for 12:50pm.

00:27:27.512 --> 00:27:29.482
How can you be reading comics when you're not even done?

00:27:30.052 --> 00:27:32.782
- I have 15 minutes. Give it to me. - No.

00:27:33.012 --> 00:27:36.152
You need to eat your cup noodles. Are you just going to skip lunch?

00:27:36.452 --> 00:27:38.552
You eat it, Ji Wan. I'm fine.

00:27:38.722 --> 00:27:41.992
No way, you're too frail. Eat this, at least.

00:27:42.062 --> 00:27:44.692
I'll check this out for you so you can read it in the car.

00:27:44.862 --> 00:27:45.862
Got it?

00:27:47.762 --> 00:27:49.062
I'm hungry.

00:28:12.092 --> 00:28:15.822
Hey, don't drink the broth. It'll be a shock to your salad diet.

00:28:27.102 --> 00:28:29.102
This is actually really good.

00:28:39.912 --> 00:28:41.682
Are you feeling unwell?

00:28:46.322 --> 00:28:49.322
My back is just a little stiff from sitting so long.

00:28:52.062 --> 00:28:53.502
Aren't you going to brush your teeth?

00:28:54.802 --> 00:28:56.032
I'm about to.

00:29:06.642 --> 00:29:10.852
Thank you. Your mom will love how comfortable these are.

00:29:10.952 --> 00:29:12.852
- Thank you. - Have a good day.

00:29:13.652 --> 00:29:15.382
(Shoealls)

00:29:15.652 --> 00:29:19.052
Ms. Lee. It's after 5pm.

00:29:19.452 --> 00:29:21.662
Weren't you supposed to leave early today?

00:29:23.362 --> 00:29:24.362
Yes.

00:29:25.462 --> 00:29:29.102
If someone happens to call for me before you close...

00:29:29.932 --> 00:29:32.572
I'll just tell them you took the afternoon off.

00:29:33.102 --> 00:29:34.172
Thank you.

00:29:37.672 --> 00:29:40.682
Is she being so nice to me because Seong Jae asked her to?

00:29:45.712 --> 00:29:47.252
(Manager Lee Su Bin)

00:29:59.562 --> 00:30:01.002
(Manager Lee Su Bin)

00:30:01.062 --> 00:30:03.632
I got a job. I'm in my probationary period,

00:30:03.702 --> 00:30:06.772
and I'm working as a manager at a franchise location for a month.

00:30:08.142 --> 00:30:09.702
It's Shoe Joy.

00:30:09.872 --> 00:30:11.542
If you doubt I'm a full-time employee,

00:30:11.542 --> 00:30:13.242
you can call the store.

00:30:13.612 --> 00:30:18.012
Why would I bother to call them? Just send your proof of employment.

00:30:18.612 --> 00:30:20.782
What? My proof of employment?

00:30:20.852 --> 00:30:25.052
Yes. You already sent your diploma, family papers,

00:30:25.122 --> 00:30:27.722
and even the certified deed to your property, didn't you?

00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:29.462
As well as proof of your video channel.

00:30:30.592 --> 00:30:32.062
That's right.

00:30:32.292 --> 00:30:37.102
We're thorough with verification. About that guy...

00:30:37.172 --> 00:30:40.402
Mr. Shin Woo Yeong. Do that, and I'll pass your profile along.

00:30:40.502 --> 00:30:42.572
No, not yet.

00:30:42.872 --> 00:30:44.412
I'll get back to you.

00:30:46.512 --> 00:30:47.512
This is nuts.

00:30:49.042 --> 00:30:51.352
It's all ruined. It's over.

00:30:51.412 --> 00:30:54.282
What, proof of employment? I don't have anything like that.

00:30:54.482 --> 00:30:56.552
How did I not think of that?

00:30:56.622 --> 00:30:59.722
How could you think a business card would be enough? You fool!

00:31:00.052 --> 00:31:01.162
Su Bin.

00:31:04.032 --> 00:31:06.632
This gentleman asked for an introduction.

00:31:11.502 --> 00:31:13.332
He's totally my type.

00:31:14.342 --> 00:31:15.342
Pardon?

00:31:15.472 --> 00:31:18.542
I saw you inside earlier. You have a really warm presence.

00:31:19.572 --> 00:31:21.142
I'll leave you two to talk.

00:31:23.612 --> 00:31:25.352
I'm Shin Woo Yeong.

00:31:26.922 --> 00:31:29.282
Hello. I'm Lee Su Bin.

00:31:31.122 --> 00:31:32.692
Now that we've been introduced, how about a cup of coffee?

00:31:34.322 --> 00:31:36.262
Just send your proof of employment.

00:31:38.032 --> 00:31:39.492
How about a beer instead?

00:31:42.302 --> 00:31:45.802
Let's agree to three beers. No questions asked, and that's it.

00:31:46.902 --> 00:31:48.072
And why is that?

00:31:48.302 --> 00:31:50.812
Because I can handle three beers, no problem.

00:31:51.342 --> 00:31:54.342
- And after that? - I'll start to feel a buzz.

00:31:55.012 --> 00:31:56.012
And then?

00:31:56.082 --> 00:31:58.712
I'd probably drop this whole facade. This mask.

00:31:58.782 --> 00:32:00.282
And I might just strip yours away too.

00:32:01.522 --> 00:32:04.692
Isn't a matchmaking agency meant to make sure there are no secrets?

00:32:04.792 --> 00:32:06.592
Do you really think so?

00:32:06.962 --> 00:32:10.462
If you check their family records, diploma, and tax statements,

00:32:10.562 --> 00:32:12.662
does that mean you know everything about them?

00:32:12.992 --> 00:32:15.032
You only know my shell.

00:32:16.502 --> 00:32:17.702
You're an interesting one.

00:32:18.102 --> 00:32:19.102
Refreshing.

00:32:23.142 --> 00:32:24.272
(Seong Jae)

00:32:25.442 --> 00:32:26.442
Just a second.

00:32:27.582 --> 00:32:28.582
Hey, Seong Jae.

00:32:28.942 --> 00:32:32.452
You went to the agency today, right? Did you give her the card?

00:32:32.852 --> 00:32:33.852
No.

00:32:34.882 --> 00:32:37.422
I'm meeting someone right now. What?

00:32:37.852 --> 00:32:38.852
What?

00:32:38.922 --> 00:32:40.422
I went to tell them about my new job,

00:32:40.422 --> 00:32:41.892
and this guy saw me there.

00:32:41.962 --> 00:32:44.592
He asked me to get coffee, so now we're having a beer.

00:32:45.062 --> 00:32:48.162
Are you seriously saying all this in front of him?

00:32:48.402 --> 00:32:52.532
Three beers, then I'm heading home. So don't worry.

00:32:53.702 --> 00:32:54.702
Hey...

00:32:59.172 --> 00:33:00.242
What is with Lee Su Bin?

00:33:02.482 --> 00:33:03.542
Was that your brother?

00:33:04.182 --> 00:33:05.182
Yes.

00:33:05.812 --> 00:33:06.912
You two must be close.

00:33:08.482 --> 00:33:11.222
He's just being protective. He tends to worry.

00:33:12.792 --> 00:33:17.062
- So you grew up well-loved. - Yes, immensely.

00:33:24.532 --> 00:33:26.502
I'd call that being overprotective.

00:33:27.042 --> 00:33:29.402
I work late every night anyway, so it's not a huge imposition.

00:33:29.472 --> 00:33:31.242
How long are you going to keep this up?

00:33:31.742 --> 00:33:33.342
Until the robber is caught.

00:33:33.812 --> 00:33:34.812
Seriously?

00:33:36.612 --> 00:33:38.252
I should just buy a car already.

00:33:40.452 --> 00:33:42.852
Okay, let me know when you're ready. I can help you look for one.

00:33:50.862 --> 00:33:54.902
Eun Oh, if you don't call me, I'll wait for you here all night.

00:33:57.202 --> 00:33:58.202
He's changed.

00:33:59.372 --> 00:34:01.072
Seong Jae has definitely changed.

00:34:02.802 --> 00:34:06.742
On days you go home after 10pm, I'll be the one to take you.

00:34:07.812 --> 00:34:09.012
Wait, is Seong Jae...

00:34:09.412 --> 00:34:10.882
Is Seong Jae making a move?

00:34:11.312 --> 00:34:13.512
Is he done playing Daddy Long Legs?

00:34:15.152 --> 00:34:19.052
I made it clear that you and Eun Oh could never be a thing.

00:34:24.232 --> 00:34:26.032
Why do I have such a bad feeling about this?

00:34:26.662 --> 00:34:28.402
My heart is pounding.

00:34:29.102 --> 00:34:30.102
Why?

00:34:32.502 --> 00:34:34.242
I'm home.

00:34:35.772 --> 00:34:36.772
Mom?

00:34:38.612 --> 00:34:42.382
Who was that? Hey, Eun Oh, are you dating someone?

00:34:42.982 --> 00:34:45.752
No, he's just a friend of a friend.

00:34:45.882 --> 00:34:49.022
He's a regular at my cafe, and his office is right nearby.

00:34:49.582 --> 00:34:54.162
- Then why was he dropping you off? - We met by chance outside the cafe.

00:34:54.422 --> 00:34:59.392
He was also leaving work late, so he gave me a ride as it was dark.

00:35:00.432 --> 00:35:02.302
Mom, there's really nothing going on between us.

00:35:02.502 --> 00:35:06.132
No man spends time on a woman he isn't interested in.

00:35:06.302 --> 00:35:08.672
He could just be worried because we're friends.

00:35:09.602 --> 00:35:10.712
Really?

00:35:13.712 --> 00:35:14.742
Well, then...

00:35:15.482 --> 00:35:17.912
Eun Oh, when do you plan on getting married?

00:35:19.852 --> 00:35:23.922
I'll marry if I find someone I love, but I'm not going to force it.

00:35:24.652 --> 00:35:26.122
Really? In that case...

00:35:26.392 --> 00:35:28.362
There's a good chance...

00:35:28.362 --> 00:35:30.732
you won't marry in the next 2 to 3 years.

00:35:31.592 --> 00:35:32.662
I guess so.

00:35:33.932 --> 00:35:35.162
All right, then.

00:35:39.902 --> 00:35:41.442
Use this to buy a car.

00:35:42.202 --> 00:35:45.312
It's the money I've been saving up for your wedding.

00:35:45.372 --> 00:35:48.182
You can buy that used car you wanted with this.

00:35:49.482 --> 00:35:52.712
No, Mom, that's okay. I can afford to buy a car myself.

00:35:52.782 --> 00:35:54.322
I told you, I have a business partner.

00:35:54.322 --> 00:35:55.922
I can't possibly accept this.

00:35:56.582 --> 00:35:57.892
Eun Oh.

00:35:58.752 --> 00:36:00.222
Why are you being so weird about this?

00:36:01.692 --> 00:36:06.632
This is from the shop you set up. Business is good, so I could save.

00:36:06.732 --> 00:36:08.832
So it's practically your money anyway.

00:36:09.562 --> 00:36:14.002
How is it practically my money? I gave it to you, Mom. It's yours.

00:36:14.702 --> 00:36:17.712
Fine. Then I earned this myself, okay?

00:36:17.772 --> 00:36:20.042
My daughter is running around to all those construction sites,

00:36:20.072 --> 00:36:22.842
so I can buy her a used car to help her out, right?

00:36:24.082 --> 00:36:25.082
No.

00:36:26.352 --> 00:36:27.352
That's not it.

00:36:28.052 --> 00:36:29.582
Just hold onto it,

00:36:30.022 --> 00:36:32.052
and give it to me when I get married.

00:36:33.392 --> 00:36:35.462
What about you?

00:36:35.522 --> 00:36:39.462
You spent four hard years at Doogle without buying a single new outfit.

00:36:39.532 --> 00:36:41.962
You paid off your dad's debt and opened the restaurant for me.

00:36:42.502 --> 00:36:43.562
Why did you do all that?

00:36:44.472 --> 00:36:45.472
That's because...

00:36:45.832 --> 00:36:50.742
I was young and energetic back then, so it didn't feel hard at all.

00:36:53.512 --> 00:36:54.512
Besides,

00:36:55.012 --> 00:36:57.452
I just landed the contract for the hanok house in Suri-dong,

00:36:58.182 --> 00:36:59.512
and I'll profit from my partnership soon,

00:36:59.912 --> 00:37:01.022
so I can just buy a car then.

00:37:02.382 --> 00:37:03.752
I just really want to do this on my own.

00:37:06.192 --> 00:37:07.222
Gosh, I need the bathroom.

00:37:17.832 --> 00:37:20.332
(Fixed-Term Deposit Passbook)

00:37:23.802 --> 00:37:26.042
Your daughter hasn't been by at all lately.

00:37:26.612 --> 00:37:27.682
I've decided to go into business with them.

00:37:28.442 --> 00:37:29.442
Oh, that's right.

00:37:29.712 --> 00:37:31.482
I have a breakfast meeting today.

00:37:31.952 --> 00:37:32.952
I'll see you later.

00:37:33.312 --> 00:37:34.382
What?

00:37:34.382 --> 00:37:37.222
What you spent on Ji Eun Oh, who isn't your real daughter,

00:37:38.052 --> 00:37:39.522
and the benefits she received...

00:37:40.092 --> 00:37:41.692
were mine and were taken from me.

00:37:49.002 --> 00:37:52.502
Look how wide this aisle is. Why would I bump your table?

00:37:52.832 --> 00:37:54.772
I'm telling you, I walked on this side.

00:37:56.142 --> 00:38:00.142
So I guess these things fell over on their own?

00:38:03.742 --> 00:38:06.112
You kept shaking your leg and kicking the table.

00:38:06.182 --> 00:38:07.182
Hey.

00:38:07.722 --> 00:38:09.122
What, you think I've got a nervous twitch?

00:38:09.552 --> 00:38:11.192
You're saying I was the one kicking the table?

00:38:11.522 --> 00:38:13.022
- Did you see me do it? - Yes.

00:38:13.022 --> 00:38:14.262
I saw you do it each time I walked by.

00:38:15.262 --> 00:38:16.962
This guy's unbelievable!

00:38:20.532 --> 00:38:21.602
Hey, get your hands off me.

00:38:22.162 --> 00:38:24.102
- Let's check the CCTV! - Hey, what's going on here?

00:38:25.432 --> 00:38:27.402
Hey, Jin Gu, perfect timing. Let's check the CCTV.

00:38:28.242 --> 00:38:29.242
Hey, what are you talking about?

00:38:29.942 --> 00:38:34.112
I'm so sorry. He's been stressed with family issues.

00:38:36.042 --> 00:38:39.982
- What about the CCTV... - Hey, just go serve that.

00:38:41.222 --> 00:38:42.822
Please bear with us, all right?

00:38:43.622 --> 00:38:46.092
To make up for it, four beers are on us, okay?

00:38:46.152 --> 00:38:47.762
- Hey! - Ji Gang Oh!

00:38:48.222 --> 00:38:49.222
This guy, I swear.

00:38:49.962 --> 00:38:51.792
Either you take off your apron and get out of here right now,

00:38:52.432 --> 00:38:53.762
or go to the kitchen and start peeling onions.

00:38:55.202 --> 00:38:57.372
Hey! Come here and clean this up, quick.

00:38:59.932 --> 00:39:01.742
How can you guys do this? I thought we were on the same side.

00:39:03.042 --> 00:39:04.642
You're the one who bumped into me.

00:39:04.742 --> 00:39:09.082
Who's more likely to bump someone? The drunk guy or the sober one?

00:39:09.912 --> 00:39:11.682
Actually, it was you. The sober one.

00:39:15.322 --> 00:39:17.252
And who are you supposed to be?

00:39:17.852 --> 00:39:19.592
That's my sister, you jerk.

00:39:21.262 --> 00:39:24.262
Listen up, guys. I was watching from over there.

00:39:24.662 --> 00:39:29.632
My brother was stumbling, I admit. But you're the one who ran into him.

00:39:30.502 --> 00:39:32.072
Hey, you high school punks!

00:39:32.572 --> 00:39:35.502
You guys live around here, right? I've seen you around a few times.

00:39:35.942 --> 00:39:38.272
You all go to Jaesu High School, right?

00:39:38.342 --> 00:39:41.012
Hey, did you hear that? She thinks we're in high school.

00:39:42.642 --> 00:39:45.282
Take your loser brother and get lost.

00:39:46.412 --> 00:39:48.322
Excuse me? This little punk...

00:39:49.182 --> 00:39:51.592
Hey, you see that over there? The CCTV camera.

00:39:52.852 --> 00:39:54.222
Let's go have them pull the footage.

00:39:56.222 --> 00:39:57.392
What, you don't want to?

00:39:58.562 --> 00:40:00.962
You seem to think you're the victims.

00:40:00.962 --> 00:40:02.202
So go ahead, call the cops.

00:40:02.462 --> 00:40:04.302
But don't even think about running.

00:40:04.902 --> 00:40:09.202
I'll search Jaesu High School and find every last one of you.

00:40:09.972 --> 00:40:14.042
We don't need to involve the police. This is a little much...

00:40:14.142 --> 00:40:15.542
Apologise.

00:40:16.082 --> 00:40:17.082
All three of you, together.

00:40:21.282 --> 00:40:22.282
You're not going to?

00:40:22.652 --> 00:40:24.252
Fine. I'll make the call.

00:40:27.492 --> 00:40:28.492
Hey.

00:40:28.792 --> 00:40:30.562
- We're sorry. - We're sorry.

00:40:35.702 --> 00:40:39.132
What? You're just letting them go? They hit me twice right here.

00:40:39.332 --> 00:40:43.242
If you hit back, you're both to blame. See?

00:40:43.702 --> 00:40:45.042
I told you not to wander around drunk.

00:40:45.342 --> 00:40:47.712
Hey, you should've gotten here sooner.

00:40:49.882 --> 00:40:53.082
- You're such a chicken. - Come on! There were three of them.

00:40:53.782 --> 00:40:56.182
Come on, let's go home. I'll get you an ice pack.

00:40:56.422 --> 00:40:58.692
You can't let Mom find out about this.

00:41:00.822 --> 00:41:02.522
Darn it...

00:41:03.662 --> 00:41:05.762
Unbelievable.

00:41:12.002 --> 00:41:13.102
Seriously...

00:41:24.412 --> 00:41:26.412
(300 Pangyo-ro, Bundang, Seongnam)

00:41:29.052 --> 00:41:30.792
(Mamdaerozip)

00:41:30.952 --> 00:41:31.952
What?

00:41:32.422 --> 00:41:34.462
- You're here. - Good morning.

00:41:36.722 --> 00:41:37.832
What time did you get in?

00:41:38.262 --> 00:41:40.692
- At 6am. - You must've left in the dark.

00:41:42.262 --> 00:41:43.262
Your headset!

00:41:43.962 --> 00:41:45.132
Take them off, Cheol Min.

00:41:45.432 --> 00:41:46.532
We're going to a meeting.

00:41:47.702 --> 00:41:48.772
A meeting? Where?

00:41:49.442 --> 00:41:51.212
Well... Cafe Agit.

00:41:51.672 --> 00:41:52.842
They have good coffee there.

00:41:53.772 --> 00:41:55.682
Wouldn't it be easier to get coffee and have the meeting here?

00:41:56.412 --> 00:41:59.682
I guess I'm just in the habit of having my morning coffee there.

00:42:01.282 --> 00:42:03.922
But we're busy. You're going to go all the way there for a meeting?

00:42:04.222 --> 00:42:07.562
I have a site to visit anyway, so it's on my way.

00:42:08.622 --> 00:42:09.622
Come on, let's just do it there.

00:42:10.322 --> 00:42:11.332
The meeting.

00:42:15.762 --> 00:42:17.132
What brings you all here so early?

00:42:17.362 --> 00:42:19.632
Hey, is Ji Eun Oh not in yet?

00:42:20.072 --> 00:42:22.342
She said she had to stop by a site and would be in later.

00:42:23.902 --> 00:42:25.842
Right, I see.

00:42:27.342 --> 00:42:28.912
We could put the front door here,

00:42:29.182 --> 00:42:32.682
and then build a wall here to partition it into separate units.

00:42:33.512 --> 00:42:34.522
My goodness!

00:42:34.822 --> 00:42:38.122
I can't believe it. How'd you think of adding a rental to this house?

00:42:38.892 --> 00:42:42.362
You said you wanted to live in this house forever.

00:42:42.822 --> 00:42:46.792
That's decades away. I want you to fix it up and live how you want.

00:42:47.392 --> 00:42:50.602
And since the kids have moved out, you only really need two rooms.

00:42:51.102 --> 00:42:53.902
That's right. My kids all thought it was a great idea.

00:42:54.402 --> 00:42:56.672
And the rental income would really help us out.

00:42:57.812 --> 00:43:00.612
The initial construction cost will be a bit higher,

00:43:00.772 --> 00:43:03.012
but in the long run, it'll be a much bigger help to you.

00:43:03.812 --> 00:43:05.082
Gosh, I was really...

00:43:05.412 --> 00:43:07.852
so upset, thinking I'd have to give up on this house.

00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:09.882
But you're a lifesaver, Ms. Ji.

00:43:11.022 --> 00:43:13.292
Not at all. I'm the one who should be thanking you.

00:43:13.952 --> 00:43:17.562
I've been dying to renovate a house like this.

00:43:19.162 --> 00:43:22.002
Mr. Jo, please take care of the 15 e-contracts...

00:43:22.002 --> 00:43:24.032
and the coordinator applications today.

00:43:24.672 --> 00:43:27.402
Oh, right. There are 11 turnkey requests,

00:43:27.502 --> 00:43:28.702
so make initial contact on those as well.

00:43:28.902 --> 00:43:31.472
My gosh, Ji Hyuk. Sorry, Mr. Lee.

00:43:32.312 --> 00:43:36.512
I had no idea you were such a whiz. You don't even look at your tablet,

00:43:36.582 --> 00:43:38.282
but you just rattle it all off.

00:43:39.452 --> 00:43:43.022
Cheol Min, let's do a progress check on the renewal tomorrow.

00:43:43.222 --> 00:43:44.222
Got it.

00:43:46.692 --> 00:43:48.592
- Shall we get going? - Yes, sure.

00:43:48.662 --> 00:43:49.662
We should finish our coffee...

00:43:50.362 --> 00:43:54.032
You said you had to go. Why so slow? Come on. Let's go.

00:43:54.092 --> 00:43:56.062
I'm late, so I'll go ahead. Okay? See you.

00:44:12.252 --> 00:44:13.252
Mr. Lee!

00:44:15.882 --> 00:44:16.882
What?

00:44:18.722 --> 00:44:19.992
I got this!

00:44:20.292 --> 00:44:22.822
- I landed the Suri-dong house! - What is she talking about?

00:44:23.262 --> 00:44:24.262
This.

00:44:24.692 --> 00:44:27.362
We're signing the contract with no discount!

00:44:57.932 --> 00:45:01.162
I came up with a new design. Their kids all gave it the okay.

00:45:01.302 --> 00:45:02.302
The estimate was even higher...

00:45:30.562 --> 00:45:31.562
Oh, man.

00:45:43.872 --> 00:45:44.912
Tell me about it.

00:45:45.172 --> 00:45:47.142
Why'd you even cross the street, Mr. Lee?

00:45:50.012 --> 00:45:52.882
I thought it was something urgent.

00:45:53.212 --> 00:45:55.322
What, you couldn't hear me?

00:45:55.682 --> 00:45:57.022
I was shouting.

00:46:02.092 --> 00:46:03.092
I couldn't hear you.

00:46:09.532 --> 00:46:11.302
Oh, I'm getting a call.

00:46:11.732 --> 00:46:13.432
Go on ahead to the cafe.

00:46:14.742 --> 00:46:16.242
Yes, this is Mamdaerozip.

00:46:27.822 --> 00:46:28.822
It feels hot.

00:46:36.692 --> 00:46:37.692
What's wrong with me?

00:46:41.932 --> 00:46:44.502
So you finally figured out a way.

00:46:44.872 --> 00:46:46.902
Yes. Oh, I'm so happy.

00:46:54.882 --> 00:46:57.242
- Right here. Looks good, right? - Yes.

00:47:01.522 --> 00:47:03.222
All right, why don't you walk me through it?

00:47:11.592 --> 00:47:12.832
That's a great idea.

00:47:13.532 --> 00:47:17.802
By adding a rental unit, the client gets a steady income,

00:47:18.332 --> 00:47:20.772
and you get to do the renovation right.

00:47:22.542 --> 00:47:23.972
I've had to come up with solutions like that before.

00:47:24.042 --> 00:47:26.842
Don't you remember? That house with three generations.

00:47:26.912 --> 00:47:29.812
That... Yes, when we volunteered for the basement unit.

00:47:30.012 --> 00:47:31.682
We pulled all-nighters for four days...

00:47:31.682 --> 00:47:34.682
and turned 2 rooms into 3.

00:47:36.082 --> 00:47:38.022
- Oh, that's right. We did do that. - Yes!

00:47:45.132 --> 00:47:46.862
Right, we did that.

00:47:47.962 --> 00:47:49.702
Oh, yes.

00:47:52.972 --> 00:47:53.972
Then,

00:47:54.332 --> 00:47:57.672
I'll draw up the final estimate and go get the contract signed.

00:47:57.872 --> 00:47:58.872
Let's...

00:47:59.512 --> 00:48:00.512
go together.

00:48:00.812 --> 00:48:01.812
Sorry?

00:48:03.212 --> 00:48:05.012
You're signing the contract at their house, right?

00:48:05.352 --> 00:48:07.252
Then don't you need the company's official seal?

00:48:07.612 --> 00:48:09.282
It's not like I can just hand out the company seal to anyone.

00:48:12.322 --> 00:48:14.022
Let me know when you're ready.

00:48:21.662 --> 00:48:23.002
What's with him today?

00:48:23.732 --> 00:48:25.002
What a dork.

00:48:38.782 --> 00:48:41.012
Giving me that look all of a sudden...

00:48:42.522 --> 00:48:44.122
She really caught me off guard.

00:48:49.592 --> 00:48:51.432
Focus on work. Work!

00:48:52.962 --> 00:48:53.962
Work.

00:48:58.802 --> 00:49:01.102
That kind of customizing isn't possible,

00:49:01.242 --> 00:49:04.102
but what if we proposed a few alternative designs?

00:49:05.712 --> 00:49:08.812
I'd like to inquire about the unit price you could offer us.

00:49:14.112 --> 00:49:17.482
I can work from 9am to 4pm.

00:49:17.752 --> 00:49:20.492
But for large parties in the evening,

00:49:20.492 --> 00:49:22.292
you might have to stay later.

00:49:23.092 --> 00:49:24.992
Oh, that could be a problem.

00:49:26.132 --> 00:49:29.462
I really have to be home before dinner.

00:49:32.672 --> 00:49:33.772
My back.

00:49:34.402 --> 00:49:36.102
- Gosh, I'm exhausted. - Ma'am.

00:49:36.842 --> 00:49:38.712
- Just 13 more before you go. - What?

00:49:38.712 --> 00:49:39.872
That'll make it an even thousand.

00:49:40.042 --> 00:49:42.282
I'd love to, believe me.

00:49:42.282 --> 00:49:43.642
But I can't, because of my daughter-in-law.

00:49:44.012 --> 00:49:46.012
- Mother. - My goodness.

00:49:48.182 --> 00:49:49.182
What about me?

00:49:51.222 --> 00:49:54.352
Hey. Look here, Da Jeong.

00:49:55.362 --> 00:49:57.622
So this is the senior center you hang out at?

00:49:58.562 --> 00:49:59.732
Now, hold on a second.

00:50:01.362 --> 00:50:03.662
Okay, I'll tell you everything. I'll tell you the truth.

00:50:04.162 --> 00:50:05.502
Come here, quick.

00:50:14.812 --> 00:50:16.112
So this whole time,

00:50:16.542 --> 00:50:18.752
you've been working a part-time job folding shopping bags?

00:50:20.352 --> 00:50:21.822
Please, I'm begging you.

00:50:22.152 --> 00:50:25.292
Just please don't tell Sang Cheol, dear.

00:50:25.692 --> 00:50:27.292
What? Mother.

00:50:27.622 --> 00:50:30.162
When did we ever ask you to go out and make money?

00:50:30.762 --> 00:50:33.392
How could you even think of getting a part-time job at your age?

00:50:33.562 --> 00:50:36.732
It's because of my age that I want a job.

00:50:37.132 --> 00:50:39.332
This isn't about anyone else. This is for me.

00:50:41.642 --> 00:50:43.372
Just wait until you're my age.

00:50:44.072 --> 00:50:46.412
I don't know when I'm going to die,

00:50:46.712 --> 00:50:48.812
and nobody has a use for me.

00:50:49.442 --> 00:50:52.282
Every single day, I just hang around, eat,

00:50:52.352 --> 00:50:55.582
and waste away. Do you have any idea what that feels like?

00:50:57.282 --> 00:50:58.292
Mother.

00:50:58.992 --> 00:51:00.592
Whatever, forget it!

00:51:01.462 --> 00:51:04.732
Since the cat's out of the bag, I'm going to work openly now.

00:51:06.262 --> 00:51:09.162
If you tell Sang Cheol, I'm running away. I mean it.

00:51:12.402 --> 00:51:15.402
But you have to promise you'll quit if it gets too hard.

00:51:15.702 --> 00:51:19.112
Don't worry, I'll never overdo it.

00:51:20.212 --> 00:51:23.282
The last thing I want is to be a sick old woman stuck in bed.

00:51:26.782 --> 00:51:27.912
Then...

00:51:28.582 --> 00:51:30.822
In that case, let me tell you a secret of my own.

00:51:33.152 --> 00:51:34.152
What is it?

00:51:46.132 --> 00:51:49.102
What? But our appointment is in 20 minutes.

00:51:49.872 --> 00:51:51.342
You go sign the contract.

00:51:52.542 --> 00:51:54.072
You said we were going together.

00:51:54.542 --> 00:51:56.542
You said you couldn't trust me with the company seal.

00:51:56.842 --> 00:51:59.112
Come on, it's not like you'd run off with the company seal.

00:51:59.782 --> 00:52:00.812
Go on ahead.

00:52:01.282 --> 00:52:02.322
Hey!

00:52:06.222 --> 00:52:07.652
No, you can't do that.

00:52:07.852 --> 00:52:12.392
I told the client you'd be with me. And now you want me to go alone?

00:52:13.192 --> 00:52:16.262
If you're this flaky on contract day,

00:52:16.262 --> 00:52:17.562
how are we supposed to build trust?

00:52:18.972 --> 00:52:23.072
I don't know what business you have, but I can't budge on this.

00:52:23.372 --> 00:52:28.212
This is an important client for us, and you need to honour your promise.

00:52:32.052 --> 00:52:34.682

(Client: Choi Jeong Min, Contractor: Lee Ji Hyuk)

00:52:44.192 --> 00:52:45.362
We're looking forward to working with you.

00:52:47.162 --> 00:52:50.202
I'll take note of your requests and get in touch.

00:52:50.432 --> 00:52:53.732
Okay. I'll look around a little more.

00:52:58.512 --> 00:53:00.112
So they finished the interior work,

00:53:00.972 --> 00:53:02.712
but they didn't touch anything above the ceiling.

My, you can really see its 70-year history.

00:53:05.782 --> 00:53:07.682
Gosh, look at those rafters.

00:53:10.682 --> 00:53:11.922
Hey, watch out!

00:53:34.042 --> 00:53:35.042
Are you okay?

00:53:45.352 --> 00:53:48.692
Thankfully, it's just a minor sprain.

00:53:48.692 --> 00:53:50.322
So there's no need to worry.

00:53:51.862 --> 00:53:52.862
Your boyfriend...

00:53:53.962 --> 00:53:55.462
- I'm not her boyfriend. - He's not my boyfriend.

00:53:56.632 --> 00:53:57.632
You startled me.

00:54:00.632 --> 00:54:02.442
It's my fault she got hurt.

00:54:03.002 --> 00:54:06.672
Take care of her for a week or two. Make sure she's comfortable.

00:54:06.942 --> 00:54:10.242
You said I should start moving it in a day or two.

00:54:10.342 --> 00:54:12.382
That's just to keep it from getting stiff.

00:54:12.982 --> 00:54:15.422
- Full recovery takes a week or two. - Right.

00:54:15.822 --> 00:54:17.922
I can manage on my own.

00:54:27.992 --> 00:54:29.002
What?

00:54:30.402 --> 00:54:33.072
- My right hand is perfectly fine. - I told you to go alone.

00:54:41.342 --> 00:54:43.582
Let's not dwell on what's already happened.

00:54:46.152 --> 00:54:47.682
Besides, it's not like I'm seriously hurt.

00:54:49.552 --> 00:54:54.052
If I say I feel responsible, you'll tell me not to worry, right?

00:54:55.192 --> 00:54:56.962
- Right. - But I...

00:54:57.792 --> 00:54:58.832
I do feel responsible.

00:54:59.432 --> 00:55:00.732
I know.

00:55:01.532 --> 00:55:04.702
And you know I'd rather you didn't make it...

00:55:04.702 --> 00:55:05.772
so obvious, right?

00:55:08.272 --> 00:55:09.302
Go on inside.

00:55:10.842 --> 00:55:12.342
This is far enough.

Thank you.

00:55:25.392 --> 00:55:26.392

Ji Hyuk.

00:55:34.762 --> 00:55:37.402
What brings you all the way here out of the blue?

00:55:37.702 --> 00:55:38.802
What did you want to talk about?

00:55:39.602 --> 00:55:41.302
I'm taking over the carpool for Ji Eun Oh starting today.

00:55:41.572 --> 00:55:43.772
She got hurt because of me when we were at a site together.

00:55:44.302 --> 00:55:45.312
Is she badly hurt?

00:55:45.572 --> 00:55:47.412
Where? How did it happen?

00:55:47.842 --> 00:55:50.642
Her wrist. It's a grade 1 or 2 sprain.

00:55:53.252 --> 00:55:55.382
So she just sprained her wrist.

00:55:56.422 --> 00:55:57.422
That's a relief.

00:55:58.792 --> 00:56:01.222
But is that all you came here to say?

00:56:02.122 --> 00:56:03.922
I was worried you'd misunderstand if I just called.

00:56:05.792 --> 00:56:08.732
- What a waste of a trip. - I'm responsible for her injury.

00:56:09.862 --> 00:56:11.672
My partner shouldn't have to be a burden to you...

00:56:11.732 --> 00:56:13.432
Did you ask Eun Oh herself?

00:56:14.972 --> 00:56:16.142
Get her permission first.

00:56:16.802 --> 00:56:17.802
Not that you will.

00:56:21.912 --> 00:56:23.612
If you're the one offering to drive her...

00:56:24.042 --> 00:56:25.982
You think she's going to be happy about that?

00:56:26.612 --> 00:56:28.822
Besides, I'm already doing it, so why the big deal?

00:56:30.582 --> 00:56:31.582
You?

00:56:31.652 --> 00:56:34.052
Yes, I told you I'd do it. And I already am.

00:56:36.722 --> 00:56:38.122
Seong Jae, are you...

00:56:38.732 --> 00:56:40.032
I told you. I have a meeting.

00:56:41.562 --> 00:56:42.862
I should probably get going.

00:57:19.172 --> 00:57:20.172
Ji Hyuk?

00:57:27.742 --> 00:57:28.742
What...

00:57:47.992 --> 00:57:50.462
Seriously, what do you think you're doing?

00:57:50.802 --> 00:57:52.302
I'm driving you from now on.

00:57:52.832 --> 00:57:55.672
I can't let someone I hurt rely on somebody else.

00:57:55.872 --> 00:57:58.472
Especially my own partner. I don't care what anyone says.

00:58:00.312 --> 00:58:01.542
Did you just smile?

00:58:01.912 --> 00:58:02.912
In a situation like this?

00:58:03.212 --> 00:58:04.442
Are you a psychopath?

00:58:05.812 --> 00:58:07.912
What are you talking about? I didn't smile.

00:58:08.382 --> 00:58:12.222
Yes, you did. You smirked. And stop speaking to me casually.

00:58:12.492 --> 00:58:14.922
It's just because you said I smiled...

00:58:15.322 --> 00:58:16.322
Sorry.

00:58:17.462 --> 00:58:18.462
Unbelievable.

00:58:19.632 --> 00:58:21.192
And what if you really did smile?

00:58:23.602 --> 00:58:24.662
That's...

00:58:25.002 --> 00:58:26.132
That would be...

00:58:26.472 --> 00:58:28.902
It's fun to mess with Seong Jae.

00:58:29.672 --> 00:58:30.672
Right, Ms. Ji?

00:58:38.342 --> 00:58:40.052
Wait, did I actually smile?

00:58:41.182 --> 00:58:42.182
Why would I smile?

00:58:43.022 --> 00:58:44.182
What was that?

00:58:45.082 --> 00:58:47.392
I smiled after getting a rise out of Seong Jae?

00:58:49.122 --> 00:58:51.022
It's not like I'm a sociopath or something.

00:58:57.732 --> 00:58:58.872
Why did I do that?

00:58:59.602 --> 00:59:00.632
Why did I smile?

00:59:03.272 --> 00:59:06.672
You're in a little late today, boss.

00:59:06.742 --> 00:59:08.682
(Mamdaerozip)

00:59:09.342 --> 00:59:11.412
You have the look of someone who just had a romantic escapade.

00:59:12.752 --> 00:59:13.752
What was that?

00:59:14.112 --> 00:59:16.952
You may be smiling now, but not for long.

00:59:16.952 --> 00:59:18.722
You have a long road ahead of you.

00:59:19.352 --> 00:59:20.352
Cheol Min.

00:59:21.722 --> 00:59:23.462
What did you just say?

00:59:24.192 --> 00:59:26.932
Hey, was that like a quack's dangerous prediction?

00:59:27.332 --> 00:59:29.732
There are two kinds of love in this world.

00:59:30.102 --> 00:59:31.332
The kind you realise first.

00:59:31.332 --> 00:59:33.102
And the kind others notice before you do.

00:59:34.102 --> 00:59:35.272
Or so they say.

00:59:35.902 --> 00:59:37.372
Who said that?

00:59:39.212 --> 00:59:41.342
My grandfather used to say that.

00:59:44.082 --> 00:59:45.082
His grandfather?

00:59:45.852 --> 00:59:49.082
Hey, is Cheol Min all there?

00:59:49.722 --> 00:59:51.482
I guess he's a genuine quack.

00:59:52.152 --> 00:59:53.922
Or a slightly unhinged genius?

00:59:58.792 --> 01:00:01.062
Anyway, aren't you headed out today, boss?

01:00:03.332 --> 01:00:04.732
I have to spend all day today...

01:00:05.732 --> 01:00:07.872
working on something quietly.

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:12.672
I have to call 28 people. Will you be all right here?

01:00:12.672 --> 01:00:13.772
Of course not.

01:00:15.542 --> 01:00:16.612
Can't you take your calls outside?

01:00:16.782 --> 01:00:19.282
No. You go do it somewhere else.

01:00:19.412 --> 01:00:20.812
You can just go work at the cafe.

01:00:21.212 --> 01:00:22.222
No.

01:00:23.482 --> 01:00:24.552
Well, that's kind of...

01:00:24.622 --> 01:00:27.522
You expect me to go to some cafe and bother everyone with 28 calls?

01:00:29.362 --> 01:00:30.362
Good point.

01:00:39.472 --> 01:00:41.272
(Cafe Agit)

01:00:43.742 --> 01:00:44.742
Ji Hyuk.

01:00:46.512 --> 01:00:47.512
You're here.

01:00:48.712 --> 01:00:50.182
What? Yes.

01:00:51.112 --> 01:00:53.712
- Is Eun Oh in? - What?

01:00:55.452 --> 01:00:59.452
She got a call about new materials for her art studio project,

01:00:59.522 --> 01:01:00.692
so she went out to take a look.

01:01:01.222 --> 01:01:03.692
Really? Well, I should get to work.

01:01:03.822 --> 01:01:05.792
- Can I get an iced Americano? - Sure.

01:01:20.312 --> 01:01:21.312
Boss.

01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:24.082
Hey, you startled me. What is it?

01:01:24.912 --> 01:01:28.152
Those cup noodles in the storage room. Can I have one?

01:01:28.412 --> 01:01:31.122
Is it that late already?

01:01:33.792 --> 01:01:34.892
Let's eat together.

01:01:44.002 --> 01:01:45.002
Listen, Cheol Min.

01:01:46.072 --> 01:01:48.132
You say some odd things sometimes.

01:01:48.132 --> 01:01:49.442
I may be paranoid, but I must ask.

01:01:50.202 --> 01:01:54.642
I need the people who work for me to be healthy in mind and body.

01:01:56.912 --> 01:01:59.782
I would never do anything to harm you, boss.

01:02:00.282 --> 01:02:02.022
Just because I made a few cryptic remarks,

01:02:02.622 --> 01:02:04.452
have you forgotten what a valuable asset I am?

01:02:06.392 --> 01:02:08.292
Humans are forgetful creatures, after all.

01:02:08.762 --> 01:02:09.762
I'll be on my way.

01:02:12.292 --> 01:02:13.692
I mean, that's what's so suspicious.

01:02:13.692 --> 01:02:15.292
Why would someone so skilled be here?

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:18.062
Even if he really just wants a quiet place to work...

01:02:18.732 --> 01:02:19.732
Hello?

01:02:21.932 --> 01:02:24.202
Actually, I was just about to get in touch with Chief Cha.

01:02:26.912 --> 01:02:28.782
Okay, I'll check on that and get back to you.

01:02:30.942 --> 01:02:31.942
Shoot.

01:02:53.632 --> 01:02:54.632
Do I...

01:02:55.372 --> 01:02:56.472
like Ji Eun Oh?

01:03:50.162 --> 01:03:52.962
(Our Golden Days)

01:03:53.092 --> 01:03:57.432
If I'd known you were so fickle, I never would've partnered with you.

01:03:57.502 --> 01:04:00.532
I have something important to say. This is it! It just came to me.

01:04:00.602 --> 01:04:02.472
Stop being so insecure.

01:04:02.802 --> 01:04:04.402
What do you mean, "What now?"

01:04:04.802 --> 01:04:06.942
You should have done a better job!

01:04:07.972 --> 01:04:09.942
What am I going to do with you?

01:04:10.342 --> 01:04:11.782
I managed just fine.

01:04:12.082 --> 01:04:14.882
Me? Your guardian. I have no idea how that happened, but...

01:04:14.982 --> 01:04:16.652
But why did you get a divorce?

01:04:16.722 --> 01:04:19.722
What do you take me for? Do you even consider me your friend?

01:04:19.792 --> 01:04:23.392
You called me here about Ji Eun Oh. Don't give me that friendship talk.

01:04:23.462 --> 01:04:25.092
As if you think of me as a real friend.
