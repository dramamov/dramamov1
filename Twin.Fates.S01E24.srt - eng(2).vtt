Did you ask me here

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.160
to warm your bed?

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.800
That's right, Feng.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.840
If so,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.040
why did you get into bed without me?

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.720
You're right.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.200

My eyes are closing.

I have no idea what time it is.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.240
I've lost track of time.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.280
If I were to guess it,

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.120
I think it'd be morning soon.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.760
It's been a long night!

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.106
(We believe the long nights
and the paths we walk under the stars)

One more take.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.480
Let's do it one more time.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:54.990
Do you find your character challenging?

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.440
It's way too challenging.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.520
Mm.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.360
After all,

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.000
this is my first time doing a role

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.160
with so many lines.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.320
It's got too many lines?

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.320
To be honest, that's not the case.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.200
I have to give a poker face throughout.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.720
However, I need to make sure
my eyes and facial expression are on point.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.000
It's all about being emotional.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:15.960
It's okay.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.210
Which is your most favorite character?

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.800
My favorite character? I...

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.320
In fact, I wonder what it'd feel like
to act as An Sha.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.320
I'd love to give that a try.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.190
I'd get to wear contact lens.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.520
Let's do the positioning from that day.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.120
Yeah, they enter the scene.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.040
We'll stick to
the positioning from that day.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.680
Both of them should be there.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.160
Is there anything dirty behind me?

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.000
- Alright.
- I'm telling you.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.560
That circular part on that machine.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.200
Action.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.720
You'll just stay there, huh?

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.360
Trying to peek at me, huh?
Peek at me as you please, then!

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.360
Did I scratch you?

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.560
Do I close this?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.040
One, two, three!

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.680
Pull it! Okay.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.000
Alright.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.320
They've all been lying to me!

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.440
Kiss me!

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.720
Have you lost your mind?

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.520
Hold her hand. There's no space here.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.520
Each of them has a face.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.320
You see the bathtub.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.080
- Okay. Let's give it a try.
- Alright.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.000
Well, normally,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.100
you'll walk by and take a glimpse.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.400
Yeah, that's it.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.320
Slow down.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.640
Bite her.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.320
That hurts!

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.840
Now, you're Chi Yu.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.440
Just kiss her.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.120
That's right.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.520
You stop here.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.800
Be gentle. Go slow.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.360
Here, ready. Hyah!

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.400
The heels definitely won't fit.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.560
The heels won't fit.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.800
Who's squatting behind me?

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.320
- Use some oil, then.
- Hahaha! Let's just use some oil.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.040
Yeah, you could turn around. That's it.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.520
Do I do it myself?

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.120
Who did this?

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.320
They stepped on the dress. And she fell.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.440
Just once. Yeah.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.840
Face him this way.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.560
He will take two steps back.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.560
Use this gesture. And push it!

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.640
Thank you all for your hard work.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.960
Do you have anything to say?

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.920
Let's wrap it up soon.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.840

I'm happy

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.440

We're shooting our last scene!

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:14.920
It's the last scene!

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.920
And I don't have to say anything.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:16.840
You don't have to say anything?

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.120
I don't. It's all about acting.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.320

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.320
