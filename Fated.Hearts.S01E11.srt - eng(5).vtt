[Episode 11]

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.920
Hurry!

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.150
Emperor.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.020
[Xia Jingyan, Emperor of Jinxiu]

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.000
Fill it up.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.510
Everyone leave!

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.829
You two, stop right there!

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.340
Raise your heads.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.290
I recognize you.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.800
Last year during the Dragon Boat Festival

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.240
at the ceremony by the Qingjiang River,

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.540
you two were there too.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.240
One is the wife of

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.270
Dai Quan, the Vice Minister of Works.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.840
The other is

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.240
the niece of the Marquis of Bao'an.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.970
Why are these two here with you?

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.960
Aren't you the wife of

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.840
Wang Encheng,
the Vice Minister of Revenue?

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.280
How did you become

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.010
the Marquis of Bao'an's niece?

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.950
Take them away right now!

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.690
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:12.750
Let's go. Hurry up.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.060
There're so many concubines
and beauties in the palace.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.590
Aren't they enough for your debauchery?

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.630
You even have to touch
the niece of an official?

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.240
How could the concubines and beauties
in the palace

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.520
compare to the peerless beauties outside?

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.560
But the Marquis of Bao'an's family...

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.420
Mother!

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.920
I didn't force them!

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.570
They were all willing.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.880
Look at you now.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.780
Do you have any bearing of a ruler?

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.780
I've been like this since I was a kid.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.720
Xia Jingshi has the bearing of a ruler,

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.690
but do you know where he is now?

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.360
I heard there's a letter from Susha.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.250
What did it say?

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.660
That Feng Suige is quite interesting.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.330
He wants to keep Xia Jingshi

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.990
to stay in Susha permanently,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.210
saying he loves and cherishes him

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.410
even more than his own flesh and blood.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.200
This is just an excuse
to keep Xia Jingshi in Susha

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.600
as a son-in-law married into their family.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.550
We absolutely cannot agree to this.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.550
I already agreed.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.839
Nonsense!

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.649
How can he, a first-rank prince of Jinxiu,

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:22.510
become a live-in son-in-law

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.170
to those barbarians in Susha?

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.440
If Xia Jingshi stays in Susha,

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.000
wouldn't Pingling City

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.630
naturally return to imperial control?

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.480
Or do you think that border stronghold

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.060
is better controlled
by powerful ministers, Mother?

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.260
If he doesn't return,

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:37.080
I can legitimately

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.210
take back his

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.080
military and political power
over the Zhennan Army.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.560
That First Prince of Susha

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.890
is quite clever indeed.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.200
He could even predict

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.170
that I would certainly agree.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.340
Xia Jingshi won't just sit around
and wait for his doom.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.409
How can he possibly
be trapped in Susha forever?

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:54.610
He's bound to come back sooner or later.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.430
By the time he returns,

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.750
Pingling City will

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.370
no longer belong to him,
the Prince of Zhennan.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:09.160
Your Highness,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.020
so you had a backup plan all along.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.150
Having him marrying into our kingdom
is brilliant.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.230
Keeping Xia Jingshi in our Susha means

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.920
our princess won't have to marry far away.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.680
This way,

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.920
we can preserve the sibling bond

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.530
between you and Her Highness,

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.430
while also keeping Xia Jingshi

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.880
firmly under our control.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.680
I'm afraid Xia Jingshi

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.750
never expected that

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.670
Your Highness would have
such a brilliant plan.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.680
Since arriving in Susha, Xia Jingshi

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.820
has been acting like he has

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.350
everything under control.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.510
I'm going to strip away

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.240
that hypocrite's

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.710
fake facade.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:37.690
That's right.

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:39.800
As long as he stays in Susha,

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.950
no matter what

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:41.650
he intends to do next,

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.580
it's all in vain.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.950
I'm telling you,

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.110
His Highness is just one move ahead,

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.040
you know?

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.890
I truly admire you.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.070
I-I admire you too.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.400
Completely impressed.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.430
So you guys think

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.560
victory is assured?

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.710
Why don't we set up a celebration feast?

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:57.950
That's a great idea!

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.530
Well...

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:59.159
Yun Fang and I

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.620
will go prepare the wine and meat
right away.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.090
Why are you stepping on my foot?

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.030
Alright, stop it.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.040
We'll have a proper celebration

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.640
after we capture him.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.140
Remember,

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.640
when people are backed into a corner,

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.370
they'll take desperate risks.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.010
Your Highness, you mean

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.270
Xia Jingshi would risk

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.270
meeting with that traitor of Susha?

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.500
That's right.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.730
By the time Jinxiu sends a reply,

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.000
it'll be too late to change anything.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.830
Even if Xia Jingshi wants to escape,

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:28.830
it'll be too late.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.300
And for such an important matter,

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.950
he wouldn't

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.390
trust his subordinates
to deliver messages.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:33.800
He'll have to meet in person.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.730
Keep a close eye on Zhengnian Hall.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.830
[Zhengnian Hall]

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.909
By the way, Ning Fei,

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:40.030
tell me about

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:41.000
what happened after

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.330
the Battle of Pingling.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.820
Why are you asking about this again?

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:47.800
As for past events,

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.800
I need to recall it slowly,

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.680
piece by piece.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.080
Please, just help me.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.720
The cliff fall happened

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.240
after the Battle of Pingling ended.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.210
I really want to know

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.810
what exactly happened then.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.040
At least tell me

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.580
what happened on the day
I fell off the cliff.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:02.350
All right.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:09.750
Officer Ning.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.210
Have you seen Commander Fu?

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.270
Haven't seen her.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:14.390
Hey, guys.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.040
Have any of you seen Yixiao?

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.650
No, no.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.360
Hey, fellows.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.600
Have you seen Yixiao?

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.880
No, haven't seen her.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.560
We were drinking and

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.630
couldn't find you anywhere.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:23.240
Hey, guys,

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:24.310
have you seen Commander Fu?

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:25.060
Commander Fu?

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.160
I think she went toward

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.040
His Highness's military tent.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.560
Okay.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:28.630
Don't worry.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.030
Come on, let's drink!

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:30.600
Someone said

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.360
you went toward
His Highness's military tent.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.190
Weiran and I thought

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:34.730
you must have had something to discuss
with His Highness,

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.260
so we didn't go look for you.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.650
What happened next?

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:42.340
Next...

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.450
After that, we drank too much

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.110
and returned to our own tents.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:47.750
When I sobered up,

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.409
you had already disappeared.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.310
Why are you being so evasive?

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.920
That night I got excited from drinking

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.430
and got into a fight with someone.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:56.750
Weiran helped settle the matter

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.150
and forced me to go to bed.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.110
Ning Fei,

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.960
you're my best friend.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:03.740
I don't remember anything now.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.140
You mustn't lie to me.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.190
When have I, Ning Fei,

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:08.120
ever lied to you?

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:08.680
Yixiao,

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.920
even if you don't remember,

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.180
you can't distrust me.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.610
Look,

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.400
I swear,

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.630
if I speak even one word of lie,

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.290
may lightning strike me down!

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:19.400
Stop it.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:22.670
Do you believe me now?

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:31.940
[You, Xiao Weiran and Ning Fei
are all orphans.]

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:32.780
[The three of you grew up together.]

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.150
Do you think what Ning Fei said

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.020
is true?

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.669
Judging by his demeanor,

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:42.130
he was probably not lying.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.870
But I still need to verify it.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.080
Xia Jingshi is almost recovered

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.910
and should return to the inn soon.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:49.320
What do you plan to do next?

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.850
Are you going to ask him directly?

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:52.220
Feng Suige told me

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.280
that memories recalled with others' help

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.280
may not be true.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.670
Only what I remember by myself

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:57.870
cannot be falsified.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.880
Even if

00:08:58.910 --> 00:08:59.510
I put a knife

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.110
to Xia Jingshi's throat now,

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.030
he might still not tell the truth.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.030
So you plan to continue pretending?

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.220
I need to make him believe

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.240
that I've completely returned

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.010
to being that Fu Yixiao

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:11.360
who was completely obedient

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.670
and loyal to him.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.830
But since he intends to harm you,

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:15.750
he must have prepared

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:16.750
all kinds of lies.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.390
How do you plan to test him?

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:20.600
Don't worry.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.150
Even a goose leaves a trace
when it files by.

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:23.280
There will be flaws.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:24.960
It's just that

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.630
every single moment spent with him

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.230
feels painful and repulsive

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.390
to me.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.850
What about Ning Fei

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.150
and Xiao Weiran?

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.630
Could they be part of Xia Jingshi's...

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:37.240
If those two

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.720
were also involved in
the attempt to kill me,

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.520
I absolutely won't let them off.

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:43.240
But I'm not sure yet.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:45.740
That fool Ning Fei.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.310
His feelings are written
all over his face.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.840
What evil intentions
could he possibly have?

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.790
Prime Minister.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:01.720
Minister Shen has arrived.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.050
Prime Minister Zhuang.

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:15.640
What does His Majesty think?

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.000
His Majesty kept

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.730
the First Prince behind alone.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:21.710
I think

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.520
His Majesty just wants to discipline

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.680
his son in private.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.120
It also spares

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:28.630
the First Prince some face.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.500
It's good, actually. Let His Majesty

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.550
give the First Prince a proper scolding,

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.410
so that brat won't

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:34.740
get more foolish ideas.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:41.510
I didn't mean to say "that brat."

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:42.120
I meant,

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.120
His Highness the First Prince.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.680
I misspoke.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.420
I'll...

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.030
Slap myself.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.030
You don't even know what you said wrong.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:51.910
Let me tell you.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.260
His Majesty will agree.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.180
Agree to what?

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:57.790
I know.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.910
His Majesty must have agreed to support me

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.080
and make the First Prince

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:05.550
hand over that Fu Yixiao.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.120
Thank you, Your Majesty!

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.320
His Majesty will surely agree to
the marriage into the family.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.140
From what I know of His Majesty,

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.080
the First Prince's proposal

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.290
aligns perfectly with his wishes.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.890
He won't decline it.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.250
So you mean

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:30.640
the Prince of Zhennan will really
marry into our imperial family?

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.840
It still depends on Jinxiu's response.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.680
This marriage arrangement

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.700
isn't up to the First Prince.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.390
Whether the Prince of Zhennan is willing

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:39.550
doesn't matter either.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:41.270
Only His Majesty

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.000
and the Emperor of Jinxiu's attitudes

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.600
will determine the outcome.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.570
However,

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:47.600
the First Prince took it upon himself

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.460
to write to the Emperor of Jinxiu.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.200
This matter can be made into
a serious issue.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.840
Do you understand what I mean?

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.890
So Xia Jingshi's

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.930
future child with Princess Xiyang

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.200
will not bear the surname Xia,

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.200
but will take the surname Feng instead.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.860
Do you understand what I said?

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:04.860
I understand.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.030
I understand completely.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:08.520
I'll contact my colleagues right away.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:11.120
We'll make sure to submit a harsh memorial

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.360
against the First Prince tomorrow.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.440
Your Highness,

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.500
news just arrived:

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:20.840
our wedding procession

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.320
has reached the Susha border.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.650
They will arrive in Yujing City tomorrow.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.120
Using the wedding procession
as an opportunity,

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.440
we can urge Susha
to exchange prisoners soon.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.080
This way, we can also take

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.960
Yixiao away from here as soon as possible.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.160
Feng Suige is someone

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.310
who's hard to read.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.340
I'm afraid if we stay too long,

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.270
something unexpected might happen.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:39.000
Understood.

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.310
You've been in Yujing for many days now.

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:42.240
Have you secretly observed

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.440
the market of Yujing?

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:44.870
Thriving businesses,

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:45.910
shops everywhere,

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.110
with abundant goods.

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:50.190
The Susha Kingdom is much stronger
than I thought.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.670
I've been stationed in
the southern frontier for over 10 years,

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.200
fought seven major battles

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.980
and countless minor skirmishes
against Susha.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.080
Of the southern frontier's annual taxes,

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.810
70% goes to military expenses.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.750
Pingling City, with its modest population
and small garrison,

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.670
is nothing compared to
the splendor of Yujing.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:07.510
Though they were defeated

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:08.970
in the Battle of Pingling,

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.490
for Susha, it was merely

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:12.070
a minor irritation

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.710
that caused no real damage.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.870
Feng Pingcheng

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.790
is a great ruler of his generation.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:18.650
Your Highness.

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:19.580
In my opinion,

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.170
Feng Suige is actually

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:22.270
not at all like

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.510
what others describe him to be,

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.330
just a bloodthirsty warrior.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:26.720
On the contrary,

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.750
he's impossible to read or figure out.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:29.360
In fact,

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.600
he's more difficult to deal with
than Feng Pingcheng.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.270
Therefore,

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:34.550
Feng Suige absolutely cannot become

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:36.010
the future ruler of Susha.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.700
If he takes the throne,

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:38.440
our Jinxiu

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.190
will have no chance of victory.

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:52.200
Your Highness, are you feeling better?

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:52.930
Much better.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:55.360
Then please drink this bowl of medicine

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.620
while it's still warm.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.630
This medicine was personally prepared
by Xueying.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:13:59.270
It can help relieve your pain

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:00.730
when the poison flares up.

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:01.570
Ning Fei also

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.480
personally brewed it by the stove.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.680
Thank you, Miss Ling.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:06.370
Your Highness.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.120
Tomorrow, our wedding procession

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:11.750
will arrive.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:12.360
By then,

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.230
your antidote will also be delivered.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.150
In my opinion, perhaps we should wait

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:17.630
and not take any other medicine for now

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.760
to avoid conflicts with the antidote.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.780
I've already tested it.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.180
The temperature is just right,
not too hot.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.200
Ning Fei says you never eat breakfast,

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.240
but Xueying says

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.120
your body is weakened by the poison

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.510
and you should eat more nourishing food.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:46.720
So should I listen to Ning Fei

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.770
or to Xueying?

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:50.610
I'll listen to you.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.510
I'll make the call then.

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:53.960
I'll have breakfast prepared.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.420
See you in the dining hall.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:07.630
Your Highness.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:08.240
Don't you think...

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:08.700
Enough.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.750
The prescription was written by Miss Ling,

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:11.620
and the medicine was prepared by Ning Fei.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.790
Yixiao just brought it here.

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:13.920
What could be wrong?

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.200
I've already failed

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.330
Yixiao once before.

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:18.240
Now I'm about to marry

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.270
the Princess of Susha.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:20.870
It will break her heart again.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:21.960
The fact that she can put aside
past grievances

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.420
and return to my side
is already remarkable.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.700
So don't overthink it.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:28.790
Yes.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.240
Yixiao.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.240
I don't remember what

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.510
Your Highness likes to eat.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:41.150
These are all

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.510
what Shunzi and others enjoy eating.

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:43.120
I suppose

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.520
they suit the taste of us Jinxiu people.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.650
These are all my favorites.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.260
Before,

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.120
did we also dine

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.780
together with Your Highness?

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:57.970
Yixiao,

00:15:58.630 --> 00:15:59.460
between us,

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.600
we never cared about rank or status.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:02.330
Please sit.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:04.960
Yixiao,

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:06.270
do you remember

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:07.200
the first time His Highness

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:07.790
hit you?

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:11.920
His Highness hit me?

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.270
You've always been one to hold grudges.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.600
You mentioned it quite often afterwards.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:19.880
I don't remember at all.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:21.390
Yixiao,

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.340
Weiran is just joking.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.520
At that time,

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.240
you had just joined the Zhennan Army,

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.080
and you didn't know my temperament yet.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.430
Once, I took you out,

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.390
and there was a shop

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.080
displaying all kinds of earrings.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.550
You kept staring at those earrings.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:34.320
So I asked you

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.360
if you liked them

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.290
and wanted them.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:58.240
Interested in these earrings?

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.470
In the death camp,

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:04.640
the instructor said
I was a lower-class person.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.770
He told me to always remember

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:07.099
my lower-class status.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.800
I shouldn't dare to dream

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.349
of possessing things

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:11.950
that shouldn't belong to me.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.319
Whether commoner or prince,

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.280
since we're all born human,

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:18.369
you should know

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.859
the value of your own life.

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:21.640
What does it matter if our origins differ?

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.369
Aren't we all ordinary people?

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.960
Don't we all experience
birth, aging, sickness, death,

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.589
joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness?

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:27.400
How can you say

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.830
you're a lower-class person?

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:29.490
From now on,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.920
if anyone dares to say

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:31.880
such things to your face,

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.010
just take this whip and lash them good.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.710
This is my imperial decree.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.260
Do you understand?

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:40.640
I understand.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:42.620
Don't be afraid.

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:45.730
Even if one day
you punch a hole in the sky,

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:47.950
I'll always be your support.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:52.640
Go ahead,

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.210
pick a few things you like.

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:05.030
And then I struck you once

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:06.030
with my horsewhip

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:07.690
because I wanted you to remember...

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:08.950
You want me to remember

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.530
that I'm not some lower-class person.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:19.050
Now that Your Highness mentioned it,

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:20.110
I remember now.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:27.530
What else do you remember?

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.530
Xueying said

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:31.350
my memory only comes back

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.610
with help from others.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.460
If I rely entirely on myself,

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.880
I won't be able to remember anything
at all.

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:40.210
Your Highness.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:41.860
Why don't you tell me about

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.460
what happened
after the Battle of Pingling?

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.390
Your Highness, let me.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:52.360
That day,

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.240
you shot Feng Suige with an arrow,

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:55.510
and our army won a great victory.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.640
That night, you were discussing with me

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.440
how your arrow

00:18:58.660 --> 00:18:59.650
missed by just a hair

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:01.590
and didn't hit him right in the chest.

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:02.170
You were

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:03.550
so regretful about it.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:04.050
We were drinking,

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:05.510
but we couldn't find you anywhere.

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:06.030
Someone said you

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:07.680
went toward His Highness's tent.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.400
Weiran and I

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.310
thought you and Your Highness

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:10.110
had something to discuss,

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:11.640
so we didn't go look for you.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.640
He's lying.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:16.960
Why would he lie?

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:22.950
When we were arguing,

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:24.870
was His Highness there too?

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:26.860
Of course he was.

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:29.050
That day, you were drunk and

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:30.000
insisted on pursuing

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.200
Feng Suige's troops.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:32.550
His Highness advised you

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:33.870
not to pursue a fleeing enemy.

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.200
But you wouldn't listen.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.120
You said the chance to kill Feng Suige

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.320
was once in a lifetime

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:39.680
and couldn't be missed.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.590
You knew I was drunk,

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:43.010
so why didn't you stop me?

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.100
Of course we tried to stop you.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:46.950
But you promised us

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:48.710
you wouldn't act rashly.

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:49.680
But later,

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:51.510
you left the camp without telling us

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:53.510
and went after Feng Suige all alone.

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:55.080
About what happened after that,

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.010
nobody knows.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:58.110
Ning Fei mentioned

00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.290
that some soldiers

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:01.240
saw me fall off the cliff by accident?

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.040
That's right.

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:03.590
We all thought

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.150
you had accidentally fallen off the cliff.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:06.480
But only after seeing you again this time
did we learn

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.410
that you were also shot by an arrow.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.220
Yixiao, don't worry.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.090
As soon as you remember

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:13.350
what happened that day

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.240
and who shot you with that arrow,

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.100
we won't let them get away with it.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.290
Of course.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.790
If I find this person,

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:22.750
I definitely won't spare them either.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:23.560
Your Highness,

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.490
don't you agree?

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:31.410
Certainly.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.830
Let's eat first. The food is getting cold.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:36.680
His Highness still needs to return to
the inn today

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.240
to handle some
important official business.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.440
What's so important?

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.340
Official business is never-ending.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:41.960
It's nothing but

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.440
some trivial matters
about the marriage alliance.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.790
What's so urgent about that?

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:45.460
His Highness's health

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.660
is what matters most.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:48.110
Your Highness,

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:49.370
please eat well first.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:50.530
I'll have Xueying

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:51.830
prepare some medicinal food

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.760
to help you recover your strength.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:54.440
Okay.

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:06.450
Why did you lie to her just now?

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:07.810
I needed to confirm

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:09.690
how much she actually remembers.

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.760
Now it seems

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.440
she truly doesn't remember anything.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.100
How many times have I asked you

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.760
to stop being so suspicious?

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.040
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.240
This is the last time.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.680
Once confirmed, I won't worry anymore.

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:25.240
From now on, Your Highness
can interact with Yixiao

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.770
more naturally and at ease.

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.750
Your Highness is already

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:55.960
breathtakingly beautiful.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.050
With these earrings,

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:58.380
it's truly perfection.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.370
I remember

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.790
last year, Father gave me a pair of

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.850
white jade earrings.

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:03.010
Where are they?

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:05.720
You want to wear the white jade earrings,
Your Highness?

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.270
But these ones

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:07.870
were sent by Empress Zhuang.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.090
They're priceless

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.240
and better match your wedding attire.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.300
On my wedding day,

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:14.550
I want to wear the ones Father bestowed.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:15.590
It's not about

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:16.910
how valuable they are,

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:17.830
but about

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.640
Father's sentiment behind them.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.480
That's what makes them truly precious.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.520
Your Highness is right.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.050
I'll go get them right away.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.110
Your Highness, I found them.

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:03.840
Sister.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:05.240
How did it go?

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:07.830
What Xiao Weiran and Ning Fei said

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:08.690
doesn't match.

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:10.240
One of them

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:11.660
is lying.

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:13.970
Who do you think it is?

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.400
I'll go ask Ning Fei again.

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:20.390
Okay.

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:34.420
Ning Fei.

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.860
Yixiao.

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:38.720
How's His Highness doing?

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.600
Don't worry.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.270
His Highness took Xueying's medicine

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:42.310
and is much better now.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:43.040
That's good.

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:45.130
You must be hungry.

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:47.240
Xueying prepared this for you.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:48.640
I don't know if you'll like it.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.750
From now on, whatever you want to eat,

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:51.680
just ask Xueying to make it for you.

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:54.240
Later,
when the wedding procession arrives,

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.510
we should select some generous gifts

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:57.110
to properly thank Miss Ling.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:23:59.560
This is good.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.770
By the way, Ning Fei.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:04.050
There's something I want to ask you.

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:05.310
Please help me recall—

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.480
did anything special happen

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.270
on the night of the Battle of Pingling?

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:10.360
Anything special?

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.240
I really

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.720
can't remember anything at all,

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.030
so please help me jog my memory.

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:15.030
If you tell me more,

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:15.680
perhaps I might

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.880
remember something.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.180
For example,

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:19.720
was there anyone

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:21.550
who saw His Highness in the camp?

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:25.830
But since you ask,

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:27.160
I do remember something.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.030
That night,

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.130
there was a merchant who visited the camp,

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:32.390
and I believe he went to see His Highness.

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:34.920
What merchant?

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.600
He said he was trading medicinal herbs.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.870
That's right.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.130
For something as trivial as trading herbs,

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:44.960
why would His Highness need to
handle it personally?

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.790
Couldn't Weiran have taken care of it?

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:47.740
I remember

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:48.960
that merchant's carriage

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.290
looked quite luxurious.

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:51.830
His status must have been significant.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.830
I didn't think much about it though.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.530
Ning Fei, come have a drink!

00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:58.230
Coming!

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.490
How many people were there?

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:03.450
I remember there was just one.

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:04.790
I never saw them anyway.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:06.720
What's wrong?

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.270
Are you thinking...

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:10.800
I'm not thinking anything.

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:12.070
I just hope you can

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:13.520
tell me more details

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:15.850
so I can remember everything sooner.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:18.240
I really want to return to

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.270
being the old Yixiao,

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:20.810
able to help you and His Highness more.

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:22.140
Wouldn't that be great?

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:23.750
I thought there was something wrong

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:24.880
with that merchant.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.570
What could be wrong with a merchant?

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:27.670
I was just asking.

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:29.210
By the way,

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:31.020
don't tell anyone about this,

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:33.200
especially His Highness and Weiran.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.130
I don't want them to worry about me.

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:36.230
Got it.

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:45.070
Why would Xiao Weiran

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:46.440
help Xia Jingshi lie?

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:48.660
Could he be involved too?

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:51.020
Were the assassins
at the bottom of the cliff

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:52.290
sent by him?

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.300
Who was that merchant really?

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:56.550
What were he and Xia Jingshi

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:57.680
plotting together?

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:00.070
Whatever it was,

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:01.590
perhaps

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.270
that was the real reason why

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:04.270
Xia Jingshi shot me with an arrow

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:06.130
and sent me falling off the cliff.

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:20.430
Were you waiting for me?

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:21.770
Since we met,

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:24.390
we've never had time to be alone together.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.200
There are some things I don't know

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.730
whether I should say or not.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:28.580
Go ahead.

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:30.390
We're not strangers.

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:31.680
I want to ask you,

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.840
what do you think about
the marriage alliance

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.840
between His Highness and Susha's Princess?

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.220
Does what I think

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.240
matter?

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:42.170
I see.

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:44.090
You must know

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.760
His Highness once promised to marry me.

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:48.350
That's right.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.590
There are things His Highness cannot ask

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:52.340
or say,

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:53.030
but I

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:54.490
have to be the bad guy here.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.590
Although right now

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:57.250
you can't remember anything,

00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:58.610
someday

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.900
you'll remember everything.

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:03.030
Since I lost my memory,

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.440
I've met many people.

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:06.270
Whether it's Xueying,

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:07.300
Feng Suige,

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:08.760
His Highness,

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.590
or even myself,

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.440
we've always been

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.790
looking at things

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:15.230
from our own perspective.

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:16.370
It seems only you

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:17.510
completely consider things

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:19.440
from His Highness's perspective.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.250
I'm simply doing

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.900
my duty in my position.

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:24.660
If you were me,

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.110
from my perspective,

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:27.440
what would you think about

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.840
this marriage alliance?

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.060
Rather than being entangled,

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:32.830
it's better to forget each other.

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:33.270
If I say

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:35.490
I never had any intention of entanglement,

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:36.690
would you believe me?

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.020
Rest assured.

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:39.200
Even if someday

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.720
I remember everything,

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:42.770
I will absolutely not have

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:44.830
any entanglement with His Highness.

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.480
There's a type of person in this world

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.110
who's naturally

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:48.910
as radiant as stars and the moon.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.400
But loving such a person

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.260
is too painful.

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:52.890
I'm a lazy person,

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:55.810
too lazy to bring suffering upon myself.

00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:59.270
It's good that you're willing to let go.

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:00.490
I'm quite curious—

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:02.900
are you more concerned that

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.510
I might entangle myself with His Highness,

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:05.500
or that I might end up

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:06.880
in pain in the future?

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:18.310
I get it.

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:21.380
Actually, you care about both.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.480
Stop frowning all the time.

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:39.190
Everything will pass

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:40.840
eventually.

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:50.670
Nine.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.570
Your Highness, I've missed you so much!

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:03.880
I've missed you too!

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.920
I've missed you too, Your Highness.

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.920
I think about you all every day, too.

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:09.230
After a while,

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:10.610
let's go home together with Master,

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:11.210
alright?

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:12.350
Sure.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:23.110
Xia Jingshi.

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:26.100
Why exactly did you want to kill me?

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:27.530
Alright,

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:28.720
go play over there for a while.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.200
Okay.

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:29.750
Okay.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:30.930
Let's go.

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:01.370
Xueying asked me to give you this.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.270
Miss Ling didn't ask you

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:12.160
to give me this.

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:14.330
You made this yourself.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:16.230
You've read the book

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:17.830
I gave you carefully, right?

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:20.310
Before, whenever the poison flared up,

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:21.880
even after taking the antidote,

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:22.790
I would still feel pain

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:24.550
throughout my body for the first two days.

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:26.310
The military doctor said I should carry

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:28.070
this kind of herbal sachet with me.

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:30.330
The herbal scent helps relieve the pain.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.310
Later,

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:33.360
before each poison attack,

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:35.430
you always prepared these for me.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.060
Your Highness.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.710
To be honest,

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:42.390
I once suspected

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.120
maybe you were the one
who wanted to kill me.

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:09.160
When you first came to Susha to see me,

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.980
I deliberately kept my distance from you.

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.650
It was because Xueying told me

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:13.770
that the person who wanted to kill me

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:16.070
must have been someone
closest and most familiar to me.

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.720
Others wouldn't have had the opportunity

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:17.960
to shoot me down with an arrow

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.040
at such a close range.

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.190
Only after reading the book you gave me

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:21.630
in the last few days

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:23.090
did I understand that

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:24.670
you were the last person

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:26.930
I should have suspected, Your Highness.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:53.820
It's all right.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:54.700
I know

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.490
that you don't understand me now.

00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:57.830
You will understand in the future.

00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:58.610
Everything I've done

00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:00.040
is for our future.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:01.910
Everything you've done

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.200
is for our future?

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.590
Then at this very moment,

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:08.370
I'll act on behalf of my future self

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:09.490
and stop you!

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:23.670
Yixiao,

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:25.680
I hope you never remember

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.240
everything that happened that day.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.070
Let all that pain

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:29.140
become the past.

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:30.920
From now on,

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.720
I will protect you

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:33.610
with my life.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.720
Are you sure
no one has delivered him messages?

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.720
We've been watching everyone

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.030
who enters and leaves the pharmacy.

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:40.750
I heard that Prime Minister Zhuang

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.160
has recently been gathering support
from senior officials.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.200
He wants to submit

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:43.910
a joint petition at court,

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:44.720
making His Majesty punish you

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.750
for your private correspondence

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:46.550
with Jinxiu.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.050
So in my opinion,

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.550
Prime Minister Zhuang has not

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:50.880
told Xia Jingshi about this.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.010
Then keep calm

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:53.310
and continue watching.

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:53.720
Yes.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:56.270
However, Your Highness,

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:57.330
hasn't Miss Yixiao

00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:58.830
been staying

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:00.760
with Xia Jingshi for a bit too long?

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.900
I-I don't mean anything else.

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.720
I just wanted to say,

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.160
could Miss Yixiao possibly...

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.420
Of course she won't!

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:10.530
Kindness must be repaid;
enemies must be avenged a hundredfold—

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:12.720
that's what the Red-Clad General is like.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.960
If an ordinary person suffered

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:14.960
such injustice,

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.640
they would have gone mad

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.400
and confronted him with a knife.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.600
But Fu Yixiao

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:20.510
could swallow

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:21.900
all her hatred whole.

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:24.200
She knows exactly what she needs to do.

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:26.360
Her composure and decisiveness

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.640
are probably beyond even
what you guys are capable of.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.270
Only a fool

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:33.300
like Xia Jingshi

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.550
would fail to cherish her.

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.310
What?

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:43.240
Are you upset that
I said a few good things about her?

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:43.920
Not at all.

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:47.830
I'll just learn from her strengths
to improve my weaknesses.

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:48.830
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:49.830
I will be humble

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:51.270
and seek guidance from Miss Yixiao,

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:52.070
striving to impress you

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:53.800
one day as well, Your Highness.

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:02.810
Why is Zhengnian Hall suddenly

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:04.470
filled with so many patients?

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:05.400
I heard

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.150
there's a real estate broker

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.280
who's been boasting around

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.030
that he knows the Young Mistress
of Zhengnian Villa.

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:10.400
These days,

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.480
many people have come because of that.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.610
I'll get to work now.

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.460
[Zhengnian Hall]

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:41.780
Miss Yixiao.

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:46.400
Where is His Highness?

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:47.650
Please get in the carriage.

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:49.510
His Highness is not far from here.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.250
What do you want from me?

00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:22.950
This tea is a tribute from the South.

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:24.230
The water used for brewing

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:25.170
is plum-blossom snowwater

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:26.750
collected last December,

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:28.870
freshly taken from the ice cellar.

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:34.960
Such fine tea

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:36.430
gulped down by you like that

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:38.090
is truly a waste of treasure.

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:39.970
What do you want to ask?

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:44.210
Yesterday,

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.510
did you learn anything?

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:47.960
No.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:51.360
You spent a whole night

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:52.630
with Xia Jingshi.

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:54.660
How could you have learned nothing?

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:56.750
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:58.910
Right, you didn't spend
the night together.

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:00.230
You merely spent one night

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:01.650
under the same roof.

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:04.080
Yet you learned nothing?

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:05.630
Were you simply

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:07.500
lost in pleasure?

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.920
When did you know?

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:11.110
What?

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.530
When did you know

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000
that Xia Jingshi was the one who shot me?

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.360
Your previous efforts to stop me

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.690
were probably for this reason too, right?

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:20.790
So you already know.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.170
Don't worry.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.000
I didn't learn it much earlier than you.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.480
I just never had the chance

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:26.360
to tell you.

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:28.130
I have no reason to hide this from you.

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:29.700
I'd prefer you knew sooner

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.260
so I could enjoy watching your reaction.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:33.190
You really are

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:34.800
incapable of saying anything nice.

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.690
Tell me,

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.670
since you were

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:39.480
Xia Jingshi's most trusted general

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.480
and a hero in the Battle of Pingling,

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:43.200
why did he want to kill you?

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:45.040
I didn't expect you
to care so much about me.

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.340
I'd like to know too.

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:48.190
Why don't you ask him yourself?

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:50.400
I'm guessing you discovered something,

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.480
something you weren't supposed to know.

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.090
He must have been forced

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.700
to take such drastic action against you.

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:00.190
Since you're a partner

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:01.440
I can trust,

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:03.240
I might as well tell you.

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:04.590
The day before Susha attacked

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:05.890
Pingling City,

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:07.510
Xia Jingshi suddenly changed

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:08.440
his battle plan.

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:09.990
Before changing the plan,

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:11.950
he received a secret military report.

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:13.400
Didn't you say before

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.720
that someone in Susha
was colluding with the enemy?

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.510
It must've been around that time.

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:18.280
Very well.

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:20.710
I'll go investigate the military report.

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:22.290
The night the Battle of Pingling ended,

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:23.150
a merchant

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:24.960
met with Xia Jingshi in his tent.

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:26.030
I should have been

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:27.090
in the tent as well.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:28.150
However,

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.880
as for what they discussed,

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:29.940
I cannot remember.

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.330
But I suspect

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:32.840
that what that merchant discussed

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:33.770
with Xia Jingshi

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.240
was exactly the reason
he wanted to kill me.

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.820
Don't look at me like that.

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.170
I'm not hiding anything from you.

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:43.030
I truly don't remember

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:44.090
who that person was

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:45.900
or what they discussed.

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:48.040
I'm staying by Xia Jingshi's side

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:49.550
just to uncover the truth.

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.900
As you know,

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:52.790
forcing a confession won't work.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:53.590
And Xia Jingshi

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:54.880
definitely won't say anything.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.540
So,

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:57.110
this might be our

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:58.150
only chance.

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.010
Stay safe.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.000
I'll have people protect you from afar.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.400
That won't be necessary.

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:06.750
I'm telling you all this

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:08.230
because I want you to know that

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:09.850
since I've agreed to cooperate with you,

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:11.360
I absolutely won't go back on my word.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.070
Whatever I should do,

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:13.320
I'll definitely see it through.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:13.800
As for you...

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.660
I'll also do what needs to be done.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:16.690
That's good.

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.670
I can't stay out too long.

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:20.110
Xia Jingshi will get suspicious.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:20.650
Wait.

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:26.800
Take this with you.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.290
What's this?

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.740
It's my heart of mercy.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.040
Yun Fang!

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:38.580
Escort her back.

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:39.400
No need.

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:40.430
For safety's sake,

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:41.080
for the next few days,

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.810
you'd better not come to see me.

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:54.280
Your Highness.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.410
Why do I feel

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:57.120
you care quite a lot about

00:38:58.130 --> 00:38:59.180
Miss Yixiao?

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:02.110
I care about her?

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:06.730
So what if I care about her?

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.280
She's a member of my household.

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.810
Shouldn't I care about her?

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:13.830
Your Highness,

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:17.410
His Majesty summons you.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:24.060
Miss. Miss.

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.960
What's wrong?
Where are you feeling unwell?

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.220
My throat hurts badly.

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:29.830
[Zhengnian Hall]

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:30.740
Take it easy.

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:32.210
This way, this way.

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:37.420
Your Highness.

00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:40.810
The carriage sent by the inn has arrived.

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:41.740
Where is Yixiao?

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.700
I only heard someone was looking for her.

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:45.960
In Yujing City,

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:47.070
she has no family or friends.

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:48.470
Who would want to see her?

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:53.700
Your Highness.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.480
There're many patients
at the clinic today,

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:56.880
and we're really short-staffed,

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.090
so I sent Yixiao to the medicine merchant

00:39:58.090 --> 00:39:59.550
to fetch some herbs for me.

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:02.430
Then please, Miss Ling,

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:04.160
tell Yixiao when she comes back

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.080
to take good care of herself.

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.490
Thank you for taking care of me

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:10.220
these past few days, Miss Ling.

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:11.210
Your Highness is too kind.

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:13.140
It's simply my duty as a physician.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.460
I'll take my leave now.

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:40.870
His Majesty has arrived!

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:46.710
Greetings, Your Majesty!

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.440
You may rise.

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.670
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:58.470
Censor Wang.

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:01.760
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.440
In your Censorate,

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.170
excluding those on official leave, sick,

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:06.030
or in mourning,

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:09.130
how many people remain in the office?

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.340
Your Majesty.

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:11.690
The Censorate

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:14.140
has 12 officials of fifth rank or higher.

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:16.480
Excluding two
who cannot perform their duties,

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.060
there are 10 working daily.

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:20.930
10 people, huh?

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:22.640
Do you know

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:24.440
how many memorials I've received

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.550
in just a few hours?

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.660
18!

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.510
10 people from the Censorate

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:38.630
submitted 18 memorials to me.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:39.920
Is your Censorate

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:42.160
so idle that you have nothing else to do?

00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:46.980
Stop exchanging glances!

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:51.110
Since you cannot answer, Censor Wang,

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:53.630
I presume Prime Minister Zhuang,

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:55.290
you can explain this clearly?

00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:58.710
Your Majesty,

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:00.960
I've heard something about this matter.

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.480
It was all because the First Prince

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:05.280
privately wrote a letter
to the Emperor of Jinxiu.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.550
This action is absurdly inappropriate

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:09.600
and unbecoming of a prince.

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:11.550
The court officials are indignant

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:12.550
and have submitted numerous memorials

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:14.320
impeaching the First Prince.

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:19.110
His Highness the First Prince has arrived!

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.150
I

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.280
pay my respects to Your Majesty.

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:43.360
Rise.

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:47.970
I summoned you here

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.520
so you could hear for yourself

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:51.630
how these people

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:53.030
are impeaching you.

00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:58.120
Your Majesty.

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:00.290
As Your Majesty's eldest son,

00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:03.000
the First Prince should
set an example for all officials.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.330
Such rash actions

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.920
offend royal dignity.

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:07.960
This matter must be strictly investigated
and punished;

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.190
otherwise, the people will not accept it,

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:12.040
nor will us court officials.
