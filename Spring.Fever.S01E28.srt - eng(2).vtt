00:00:32.608 --> 00:00:35.552
(Spirit Tablet of Late Ancestress Zhou,
Wife of Master Lu)

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.120
(Madam,)

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.640
(to maintain Ningzhou's stability,)

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.200
(I let you avoid
confessing your crimes temporarily.)

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.640
(But don't worry.)

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.160
(It won't be long)

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.240
(before the full truth comes to light.)

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.840
(The deceased)

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.680
(won't let you
erase their grievances casually.)

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.568
Where's Chenghuan?

00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:28.448
After Grandmother passed,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.200
she took poison and died too.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.240
You've fully recovered?

00:01:41.344 --> 00:01:43.000
She left me the antidote
before she died.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.880
A'man,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.760
she never truly meant to harm Jin.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.640
She was despicable, but she...

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.960
She wasn't a good person.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.360
But

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.720
she was a good grandmother.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.160
You've just recovered.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.160
You should rest more.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.800
Once matters in Ningzhou are settled,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.040
will you take Jin away?

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.040
You'll always be Jin's father.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.520
After things are over here,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.640
you may visit her anytime.

Why come here instead?

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.720
Just come with me. Leave it behind.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.920
Jin?

Mother.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.920
Mother.

Iron feet go, stamping the ground.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.000
Over South Mountain, stepping around.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.160
South Mountain high,
North Dipper in the sky.

The master buys a cow to tie.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.800
It's windy here.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.640
If the candle goes out,
Jin might get scared.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.640
Let's use this instead.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.760
Father, tell me a story.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.760
When is your birthday?

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.080
March 13th.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.000
March 13th?

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.720
Then your star sign shows

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.360
the ruling star of Horn Mansion.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.400
According to the legend,

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.960
the Horn Lord was Chang'e's brother.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.920
But his wife violated celestial laws

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.160
and was banished to earth.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.400
The Horn Lord couldn't bear
seeing his wife suffer on earth.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.280
So he requested punishment

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.720
to accompany his wife on earth.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.080
She's asleep.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.480
Look.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.520
The little one finally fell asleep.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.680
Look.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.840
Look over there.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.040
Those two brightest stars.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.000
One above, one below. See them?

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.480
Those form Jin's star sign.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.560
What about mine?

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.880
Yours is there.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.480
I never thought

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.280
so many people with nothing

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.520
would match stars in the sky.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.880
Exactly.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.480
So as long as one lives,

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.240
they can't truly have nothing.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.360
Then what meaning

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.240
does Jin's star hold?

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.520
When the Seven Eastern Stars
form a dragon,

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.360
it serves as the dragon's foot

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.920
and also its eye.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.880
Every year at early spring dusk,

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.640
when dragon feet appear
on eastern horizon,

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.560
farmers know to begin plowing.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.760
It's the so-called
"Dragon Head-raising Day".

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.600
By that logic,

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.560
I have an extraordinary daughter.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.400
It proves you're extraordinary too.

It's uncertain now.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.280
But

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.360
I promise you.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:00.960
It'll be soon.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.920
Okay.

When I sought divorce before,

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.080
you slapped me back to the Lu family.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.880
Now that the Lu family is useless,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.920
you want me to marry someone else?

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.160
Father,

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.360
it's no use.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.480
It's too late.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.440
I'm carrying Lu Shi'an's child.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.120
The physician has already told me.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.640
Take this.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.000
What?

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.680
You dare defy me?

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.800
You always say

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.560
I'm just a lowly
concubine-born daughter.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.640
Only by obeying you

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.600
can I secure my position
as the lady of the Lu family

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.000
and be considered human.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.680
But now I think differently.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.480
As long as my child is born safely

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.960
and calls me Mother,

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.440
I'll be the most important person

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.760
in his world.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.240
I'll never let anyone harm him.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.520
Stop!

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.880
You were once
the most important person in my life.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.480
But you kept reminding me

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.360
that I, a concubine-born daughter,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.120
was just an insignificant tool to you.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.840
Have you grown tired of living?

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.640
The Madam's death

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.800
has angered many local gentry.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.520
Lord Xia,

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.680
the Lu family can't afford more deaths.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:04.480
You...

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:33.680
A'man.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.800
Since you left,

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.120
I've truly become alone in this world.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.320
Shi'an,

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.520
that's not true.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.480
We can have another child.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.520
A child that won't leave

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.160
and can grow up by your side.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.240
Never again.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.440
It will never happen again.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:01.720
Jinzhi,

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.040
I used to hate you.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.400
I hated how you looked down on me
yet married me.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.480
But after all I've been through,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.400
I realize I wronged you.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.000
From the very beginning,

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.720
my heart belonged only to A'man.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.080
When we first married,

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.920
you said I was your wife,

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.280
and we'd be harmonious partners.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.160
You said that!

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:38.880
Yes, Jinzhi.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.360
I said we'd be harmonious partners.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.520
But I dared not said

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.640
I love you.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:48.960
I indulged you

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.360
to ensure A'man's comfort in our home.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.160
I wanted a peaceful home,

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.360
Grandmother content,

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.240
and Mother spared punishment.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.040
But Xia Jinzhi,

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.760
I feared you.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.520
I never loved you.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.240
I shouldn't have married you.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:15.760
Why?

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.320
Why when I realized I love you,

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.120
you stop pretending?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.800
Lu Shi'an!

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.640
No matter what I do, you will never

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.680
accept me, will you?

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.480
Xia Jinzhi,

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.720
I've wronged you.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.280
You may remain in the Lu family

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.200
as the young mistress.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:03.800
But between us,

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.280
there will be nothing more.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.760
No need.
