00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:19.633
Let's go.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.865
These are your pills.

00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:21.866
Take them in half an hour.

00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.133
Half an hour?

00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.466
That long?

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.165
Let go!

00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.166
I'll let you go then.

00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:53.866
You're so strong.

00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:56.466
Don't do this.

00:00:56.467 --> 00:00:57.633
Let go of me!

00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:58.966
Beg me.

00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:01.832
Help!

00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:02.865
Help!

00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.633
- Help! - Let go of me! Let go!

00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.000
Help!

00:02:57.266 --> 00:03:00.766

(Episode 13)

00:03:28.133 --> 00:03:29.133
Dad.

00:03:31.033 --> 00:03:32.400
You're looking good.

00:03:35.366 --> 00:03:36.566
How's it in there?

00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:41.200
They know I'm your son,

00:03:41.566 --> 00:03:42.566
so they ignore me.

00:03:44.666 --> 00:03:45.666
That's even better.

00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:48.066
Less contact, less friction.

00:03:48.766 --> 00:03:49.766
Remember.

00:03:50.366 --> 00:03:51.733
If anything happens,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
call the guards.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.400
You're a grown man.

00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:56.366
You need to know how to protect yourself, okay?

00:04:04.466 --> 00:04:05.466
Dad.

00:04:07.966 --> 00:04:09.633
If you have to be punished for your wrongdoings,

00:04:11.133 --> 00:04:13.200
how come some people get away with it?

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.200
They won't.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.133
Everyone to pay for their wrongdoings.

00:04:21.133 --> 00:04:22.400
I'm no exception.

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:28.400
This is your coffee with less sugar.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Thank you for your patronage.

00:04:30.266 --> 00:04:31.266
Mr. Fei.

00:04:32.133 --> 00:04:33.532
Whenever I think of Judge Qin,

00:04:33.533 --> 00:04:34.533
Judge Qin appears.

00:04:34.533 --> 00:04:35.533
It's 1:15pm already.

00:04:35.533 --> 00:04:36.533
Your coffee is ready.

00:04:36.533 --> 00:04:37.533
I'll pour it for you right away.

00:04:46.966 --> 00:04:48.199
Judge Qin, here's your coffee.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.200
Okay.

00:04:51.533 --> 00:04:52.533
I'm sorry.

00:04:52.733 --> 00:04:53.866
I should be the one apologizing.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.732
Take off your ring. I'll wipe it for you.

00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:56.733
Okay.

00:04:56.866 --> 00:04:57.866
Here.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.266
It's all wet. Gosh.

00:04:59.733 --> 00:05:00.800
I'm sorry.

00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:03.600
- I'm sorry. Please forgive me. - Don't say that.

00:05:03.733 --> 00:05:04.733
- Thank you. - All right.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.166
Thank you. See you tomorrow.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.665
You can walk on your own already.

00:05:19.666 --> 00:05:21.600
Yes, I can walk on my own now.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.400
What happened to your face?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.800
It's nothing. Just now...

00:05:29.466 --> 00:05:30.466
Right?

00:05:31.533 --> 00:05:32.766
He raped a nurse.

00:05:43.966 --> 00:05:45.166
Did you clean up his mess?

00:05:45.866 --> 00:05:46.866
We paid her,

00:05:47.266 --> 00:05:48.466
so she probably won't dare to say anything.

00:05:51.066 --> 00:05:52.333
Does he still get seizures?

00:05:53.366 --> 00:05:54.366
Sometimes,

00:05:54.633 --> 00:05:56.133
but it's not as bad as before.

00:05:56.266 --> 00:05:58.033
Hey. Do you think I can't hear you?

00:05:58.666 --> 00:06:00.365
Anyway, after seeing the priest tomorrow,

00:06:00.366 --> 00:06:01.465
I won't need any more medication,

00:06:01.466 --> 00:06:03.166
and I'll even be able to kill a few tigers.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.466
I've arranged everything.

00:06:07.866 --> 00:06:09.333
It's at the chapel nearby.

00:06:15.133 --> 00:06:16.133
Xiao Lie.

00:06:16.266 --> 00:06:17.365
Be careful.

00:06:17.366 --> 00:06:18.399
You're not fully recovered yet.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.833
I'm already being very careful.

00:06:22.133 --> 00:06:23.133
Where does it hurt?

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.400
Guess.

00:06:24.433 --> 00:06:25.433
It hurts here.

00:06:26.966 --> 00:06:27.966
It hurts so much.

00:06:29.533 --> 00:06:30.533
Thank you.

00:06:31.966 --> 00:06:32.966
Han Gang.

00:06:33.933 --> 00:06:35.633
Do you really believe in exorcism?

00:06:36.233 --> 00:06:37.366
I don't think Heaven will even take us...

00:06:37.733 --> 00:06:38.965
in the future.

00:06:38.966 --> 00:06:39.966
Hey, do you remember...

00:06:39.967 --> 00:06:41.566
when I almost died last time,

00:06:41.966 --> 00:06:42.966
I ended up surviving...

00:06:42.967 --> 00:06:44.533
after a priest gave me a bracelet.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.333
It'll be the same this time.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.933
I will get better very soon.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.800
Xiao Lie.

00:06:50.033 --> 00:06:51.033
Dad...

00:06:51.266 --> 00:06:52.266
is in prison.

00:06:52.433 --> 00:06:53.465
If I die too...

00:06:53.466 --> 00:06:54.466
Spit that out.

00:06:55.066 --> 00:06:56.266
Spit it out and say it again.

00:06:58.866 --> 00:06:59.932
Then, the Han family business...

00:06:59.933 --> 00:07:01.200
will be in your hands.

00:07:01.666 --> 00:07:04.199
However, Dad and I know...

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.200
that you've never wanted to get involved...

00:07:05.201 --> 00:07:06.533
in the Han family business, right?

00:07:07.466 --> 00:07:08.600
We're all a part of the Han family.

00:07:09.333 --> 00:07:10.566
It's not about whether I want to or not.

00:07:12.433 --> 00:07:14.466
Anyway, as long as I am still here,

00:07:14.733 --> 00:07:15.999
I'll definitely support you.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.732
You can do whatever you want.

00:07:17.733 --> 00:07:18.733
All right?

00:07:18.933 --> 00:07:20.199
What are you trying to do now?

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.233
Stop looking and remove the bracelet for me.

00:07:22.466 --> 00:07:23.533
All right, keep it.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.666
Why are you giving me your bracelet?

00:07:26.966 --> 00:07:28.199
I told you.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.266
Dad and I...

00:07:29.566 --> 00:07:31.633
will support you and protect you.

00:08:08.166 --> 00:08:09.433
Do you hate me that much?

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.866
You'd rather be on night duty...

00:08:14.633 --> 00:08:15.833
just to avoid me?

00:08:17.666 --> 00:08:20.600
Nurses are required to take turns doing night duty.

00:08:44.233 --> 00:08:46.066
Mr. Han doesn't want anyone around.

00:08:46.733 --> 00:08:48.432
We'll make a donation to your church...

00:08:48.433 --> 00:08:49.433
as compensation.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.200
I understand.

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:54.633
I got it.

00:08:57.833 --> 00:08:58.833
Is it done?

00:08:59.233 --> 00:09:00.266
Almost.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Look, it's a girl.

00:09:03.433 --> 00:09:04.733
Look at her face.

00:09:04.833 --> 00:09:06.366
That guy is not a picky eater.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Young Master Gang.

00:09:08.001 --> 00:09:09.366
It's all set. You can go in now.

00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:10.466
Boss.

00:09:10.733 --> 00:09:11.733
Get lost.

00:09:11.733 --> 00:09:12.733
What's going to happen to me?

00:09:13.066 --> 00:09:14.066
Let's go.

00:09:15.133 --> 00:09:17.032
Are you afraid the priest will eat me up?

00:09:17.033 --> 00:09:18.033
Let's go. It's fine.

00:09:21.133 --> 00:09:22.133
Close the door.

00:09:23.666 --> 00:09:24.833
Move the wheelchair.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.200
Let's go.

00:09:36.033 --> 00:09:37.133
Hey, Father.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.400
How are you?

00:09:38.433 --> 00:09:39.433
I'm Han Gang.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.133
Here's the thing.

00:09:41.433 --> 00:09:43.533
I've been a bit unlucky lately.

00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:47.033
I got into a car accident and hurt my leg.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.600
So I want you to help me...

00:09:50.433 --> 00:09:51.433
ward off evil spirits.

00:09:51.933 --> 00:09:53.065
Take your time.

00:09:53.066 --> 00:09:54.066
There's no rush.

00:09:54.066 --> 00:09:55.066
What's important is to be quick.

00:09:55.233 --> 00:09:56.466
I'll just have a chat...

00:09:56.633 --> 00:09:57.633
with your boss first.

00:10:17.666 --> 00:10:18.666
Qin Yu.

00:10:19.933 --> 00:10:20.933
Kneel down.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Okay.

00:10:29.633 --> 00:10:30.633
Let's talk it out.

00:10:40.033 --> 00:10:41.033
Close your eyes.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.800
Jenny.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.133
What is it, Judge Qin?

00:11:42.333 --> 00:11:43.365
Just now, I accidentally...

00:11:43.366 --> 00:11:45.466
got B04's statement dirty.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.765
Can you print a new one?

00:11:46.766 --> 00:11:47.932
- Sure. - I'm sorry.

00:11:47.933 --> 00:11:48.933
It's okay.

00:11:49.966 --> 00:11:51.032
Can you give it to me...

00:11:51.033 --> 00:11:52.033
before the trial starts at 2pm?

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.066
No problem. I'll get it to you soon.

00:12:06.133 --> 00:12:07.133
Thank you.

00:12:08.533 --> 00:12:09.533
Madam.

00:12:09.833 --> 00:12:11.199
Han Gang got shot in the head.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.200
It's confirmed that he's dead.

00:12:12.201 --> 00:12:14.333
We haven't found any witnesses at the scene.

00:12:14.533 --> 00:12:16.366
We found the priest in the prayer room.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.600
He was drugged.

00:12:17.633 --> 00:12:18.766
He's at the hospital now.

00:12:19.266 --> 00:12:20.966
We'll take his statement when he wakes up.

00:12:21.466 --> 00:12:22.466
That's all we've got for now.

00:12:31.733 --> 00:12:33.166
Are you the deceased's family?

00:12:33.933 --> 00:12:35.099
He's the deceased's brother.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.100
Please take a look.

00:12:36.101 --> 00:12:37.333
Is this your brother, Han Gang?

00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:37.633
The priest must have taken something like a sedative.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.333
That's why he lost consciousness.

00:14:40.266 --> 00:14:41.565
Fortunately, it didn't do too much damage...

00:14:41.566 --> 00:14:43.000
to his body.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.966
He'll wake up soon after the IV drip ends.

00:14:46.466 --> 00:14:47.799
A few weeks ago,

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.832
the Anti-Narcotics Unit found out...

00:14:48.833 --> 00:14:50.565
that someone was using underage students...

00:14:50.566 --> 00:14:51.566
to transport drugs.

00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:54.600
At around 8:20am on October 2nd,

00:14:55.033 --> 00:14:56.466
after receiving a report from the school,

00:14:56.866 --> 00:14:58.532
the Anti-Narcotics Unit followed a student...

00:14:58.533 --> 00:14:59.966
to the location of a drug deal.

00:15:35.366 --> 00:15:36.366
What did you say?

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.166
He was shot and killed in the church.

00:15:44.866 --> 00:15:45.866
Han Gang is...

00:15:56.966 --> 00:15:57.966
Dad!

00:16:00.333 --> 00:16:01.333
Dad, are you okay?

00:16:05.066 --> 00:16:06.066
Dad.

00:16:06.366 --> 00:16:07.366
Dad!

00:16:07.666 --> 00:16:08.666
Doctor!

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.600
Dad!

00:16:12.733 --> 00:16:13.766
Call for help!

00:16:16.366 --> 00:16:17.366
Who do you think...

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.800
killed Han Gang?

00:16:19.233 --> 00:16:20.233
Madam.

00:16:20.234 --> 00:16:21.799
That guy did all sorts of bad things.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:22.800
He deserved it.

00:16:22.801 --> 00:16:24.000
Just think of it as karma.

00:16:24.266 --> 00:16:25.266
It's a good thing.

00:16:25.267 --> 00:16:27.200
He wanted an exorcism, so he met an exorcist.

00:16:27.266 --> 00:16:28.299
What do you know?

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.465
It wasn't an exorcist.

00:16:29.466 --> 00:16:31.333
It's what they say,

00:16:31.633 --> 00:16:32.633
"You reap what you sow."

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.433
Sure. We don't need to investigate then.

00:16:34.666 --> 00:16:36.033
That's right. There's no need.

00:16:38.566 --> 00:16:40.366
The killer didn't kill the priest to silence him.

00:16:40.633 --> 00:16:41.633
It doesn't look like...

00:16:41.633 --> 00:16:42.633
the work of a gangster or a professional killer.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.232
What if...

00:16:46.233 --> 00:16:48.133
we think of it as revenge?

00:16:48.833 --> 00:16:50.632
Let's say the killer knew Han Gang.

00:16:50.633 --> 00:16:51.766
That would make sense.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
I agree.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.600
The killer knew Han Gang's every move.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
He must have observed and planned everything...

00:16:59.033 --> 00:17:01.266
before he did it.

00:17:02.466 --> 00:17:03.933
You guys, get last week's CCTV footage...

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.533
from all the streets...

00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:07.666
near the hospital and the church.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.233
Check carefully.

00:17:09.666 --> 00:17:11.233
The killer could be in the footage.

00:17:11.533 --> 00:17:12.533
- Yes, Madam. - Yes, Madam.

00:17:18.066 --> 00:17:19.066
Mr. Fei.

00:17:19.633 --> 00:17:21.200
Judge Qin, what brings you here?

00:17:22.433 --> 00:17:23.600
Are you craving my coffee?

00:17:23.666 --> 00:17:24.666
No.

00:17:24.766 --> 00:17:27.732
I don't know where I lost my ring today.

00:17:27.733 --> 00:17:29.733
I've been looking all over for it, but I couldn't find it.

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:31.265
I thought maybe I dropped it here.

00:17:31.266 --> 00:17:32.266
Today?

00:17:32.333 --> 00:17:33.333
Did you come today?

00:17:33.766 --> 00:17:35.133
I come here at 1:15pm every day.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.965
That's right. That's your habit.

00:17:36.966 --> 00:17:37.966
1:15pm.

00:17:38.333 --> 00:17:39.333
Look for it.

00:17:39.333 --> 00:17:40.333
That's right.

00:17:40.333 --> 00:17:41.333
So...

00:17:41.334 --> 00:17:43.033
- I grabbed the coffee from here. - That's right.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.199
I usually don't touch anything else...

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.432
after I get my coffee.

00:17:46.433 --> 00:17:48.633
- Right. - I usually get sugar here.

00:17:49.466 --> 00:17:50.533
Is it in the sugar bowl?

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:51.900
Let's see.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:52.900
Let's pour everything out.

00:17:56.166 --> 00:17:57.166
It's really here.

00:17:57.167 --> 00:17:59.200
- Is this it? - It is.

00:17:59.266 --> 00:18:00.266
I'm so careless.

00:18:00.267 --> 00:18:01.665
I'm glad we found it in the sugar bowl.

00:18:01.666 --> 00:18:04.133
Make sure you take good care of your ring from now on.

00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:05.766
- Okay, thank you. - You're welcome.

00:18:05.866 --> 00:18:06.866
- Okay, bye. - All right.

00:18:06.966 --> 00:18:08.666
- See you at 1:15pm. Bye. - Okay.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.600
Hello, Father.

00:18:24.766 --> 00:18:26.266
I'm Senior Inspector Tang Xuan,

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.666
from the Eastern District Police Station.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.066
Officer Tang, nice to meet you.

00:18:30.466 --> 00:18:31.733
Could we have a chat with you?

00:18:31.933 --> 00:18:32.933
Yes.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:34.799
At the scene,

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:35.800
we found a bottle.

00:18:35.801 --> 00:18:37.000
Apart from heal-all,

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.000
there were also traces of sedatives.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.432
Do you remember...

00:18:40.433 --> 00:18:42.800
who gave you this bottle of heal-all?

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.433
I brought it myself.

00:18:44.866 --> 00:18:45.866
Do you remember...

00:18:46.066 --> 00:18:47.733
if anyone touched the bottle?

00:18:49.166 --> 00:18:50.333
I don't really remember.

00:18:50.966 --> 00:18:52.066
At the time,

00:18:52.366 --> 00:18:53.966
there were so many people in the congregation.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.833
Before you fainted,

00:18:57.133 --> 00:18:58.833
who took you to the confessional?

00:18:59.433 --> 00:19:00.466
I remember that.

00:19:01.133 --> 00:19:02.133
It was a man.

00:19:02.666 --> 00:19:03.666
He held me up.

00:19:04.033 --> 00:19:05.433
I even looked at him.

00:19:05.933 --> 00:19:07.466
Can you help us make a facial composite?

00:19:11.733 --> 00:19:12.733
I can try.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.800
Okay.

00:19:20.366 --> 00:19:21.366
Come in.

00:19:21.566 --> 00:19:22.566
Madam.

00:19:22.833 --> 00:19:24.000
We got the composite that the priest made.

00:20:23.833 --> 00:20:24.999
Congratulations, Chief Justice Lu.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
You deserve it.

00:20:26.133 --> 00:20:28.000
You were the people's choice.

00:20:28.633 --> 00:20:30.232
Thank you, everyone.

00:20:30.233 --> 00:20:31.233
Come on.

00:20:32.166 --> 00:20:34.366
I'll need your support in the future.

00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:36.232
- Come on, cheers. - Let's toast to Chief Justice Lu.

00:20:36.233 --> 00:20:37.932
- Come on. - Cheers.

00:20:37.933 --> 00:20:38.933
Congratulations.

00:21:22.966 --> 00:21:23.966
Inspector Tang.

00:21:24.633 --> 00:21:26.000
I want to file a complaint about the police's abuse of power.

00:21:26.366 --> 00:21:27.400
You're following and monitoring me,

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.033
with the intent of invading my privacy.

00:21:32.666 --> 00:21:33.866
Is there a misunderstanding?

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.933
My men wanted to invite you here...

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.533
to clarify some questions for us.

00:21:38.866 --> 00:21:40.600
Did you happen to go the same way?

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.332
I'm here now.

00:21:42.333 --> 00:21:43.333
What do you want to know?

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.600
What does this mean?

00:21:51.933 --> 00:21:52.933
This is...

00:21:52.934 --> 00:21:54.633
the composite sketch of Han Gang's killer.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.466
Judge Qin, what do you think of it?

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.766
It looks familiar,

00:22:02.266 --> 00:22:03.800
but I can't remember where I've seen him before.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.633
Don't you think...

00:22:06.433 --> 00:22:07.466
these eyes look like yours?

00:22:11.933 --> 00:22:13.033
These eyes...

00:22:13.466 --> 00:22:14.533
look a bit like yours.

00:22:20.833 --> 00:22:22.532
Han Gang's time of death...

00:22:22.533 --> 00:22:24.133
was between 1pm and 2pm.

00:22:24.433 --> 00:22:25.433
Judge Qin,

00:22:25.633 --> 00:22:26.933
where were you at that time?

00:22:27.833 --> 00:22:29.533
Is this an official interrogation?

00:22:30.033 --> 00:22:31.165
Should we go to the interrogation room?

00:22:31.166 --> 00:22:32.566
Just tell me where you were.

00:22:33.233 --> 00:22:35.366
Isn't that the simplest way...

00:22:35.566 --> 00:22:37.000
to clear your name?

00:22:37.933 --> 00:22:39.200
It doesn't have to be so complicated.

00:22:39.633 --> 00:22:41.133
In a criminal trial,

00:22:41.466 --> 00:22:43.466
the responsibility for proof lies with the prosecution.

00:22:44.033 --> 00:22:46.233
You also have to make sure it's indisputable.

00:22:46.566 --> 00:22:49.166
The defendant doesn't have to prove his innocence.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.233
Are you refusing to answer?

00:22:52.433 --> 00:22:53.832
Cooperating with police investigations...

00:22:53.833 --> 00:22:55.366
is every citizen's responsibility.

00:22:55.966 --> 00:22:57.433
If you skip parts of the procedure...

00:22:57.766 --> 00:22:59.466
just because I know you,

00:23:01.233 --> 00:23:02.433
it wouldn't be appropriate.

00:23:15.933 --> 00:23:16.933
Mr. Fei.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.466
- You're Mr. Fei, right? - Yes.

00:23:19.733 --> 00:23:20.733
I'm sorry.

00:23:20.734 --> 00:23:22.199
We're closed.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.200
Come back tomorrow.

00:23:24.466 --> 00:23:25.665
I'm Senior Inspector Tang Xuan...

00:23:25.666 --> 00:23:27.200
from the Eastern District Police Station.

00:23:28.133 --> 00:23:29.733
How can I help you?

00:23:29.866 --> 00:23:30.866
I'd like to ask...

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.366
if you remember...

00:23:32.533 --> 00:23:34.033
most of the customers who come here.

00:23:35.033 --> 00:23:36.865
Most of my customers are regulars.

00:23:36.866 --> 00:23:39.166
If they are regulars, I remember most of them.

00:23:40.133 --> 00:23:41.799
Your shop is so close to the courthouse.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.333
Do you get a lot of customers from there?

00:23:44.866 --> 00:23:45.866
Yes.

00:23:46.033 --> 00:23:47.766
Just like Judge Qin.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.365
He comes here every day.

00:23:49.366 --> 00:23:50.433
After lunch,

00:23:50.766 --> 00:23:51.966
he orders a cup of coffee.

00:23:52.166 --> 00:23:53.232
He's very punctual.

00:23:53.233 --> 00:23:54.632
He comes every day at 1:15pm.

00:23:54.633 --> 00:23:55.933
I guess it's because he's a judge.

00:23:56.833 --> 00:23:58.466
Do you remember if he came on time as usual...

00:23:58.633 --> 00:24:00.065
last Friday?

00:24:00.066 --> 00:24:01.399
Last Friday?

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.400
Yes.

00:24:02.401 --> 00:24:04.965
I remember there were so many customers last Friday.

00:24:04.966 --> 00:24:06.632
I was so overwhelmed.

00:24:06.633 --> 00:24:08.632
Then, when it was almost closing time,

00:24:08.633 --> 00:24:10.233
he came to the shop and said...

00:24:10.466 --> 00:24:11.800
that he dropped his ring here.

00:24:12.333 --> 00:24:14.866
He and I even found it in the sugar bowl,

00:24:15.033 --> 00:24:17.366
so I remember it very clearly.

00:24:20.733 --> 00:24:22.165
I know Judge Qin too,

00:24:22.166 --> 00:24:24.032
but I don't think I usually see him...

00:24:24.033 --> 00:24:25.033
wearing a ring.

00:24:25.033 --> 00:24:26.033
He does.

00:24:26.366 --> 00:24:27.366
One time,

00:24:27.533 --> 00:24:29.432
he accidentally spilled coffee when he was grabbing the cup...

00:24:29.433 --> 00:24:30.433
and burned himself.

00:24:30.633 --> 00:24:31.999
I even wiped it off for him.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.733
I even took off his ring to wipe it.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Madam.

00:24:38.433 --> 00:24:40.266
What exactly are you trying to ask?

00:24:41.166 --> 00:24:42.166
I'm done asking.

00:24:42.366 --> 00:24:43.366
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.833
- Thank you. - Please come again.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.400
Take care.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.400
Great.

00:24:50.566 --> 00:24:52.200
Judge Qin has an alibi.

00:24:53.033 --> 00:24:54.366
I asked his secretary.

00:24:54.733 --> 00:24:55.733
She also said...

00:24:55.734 --> 00:24:57.433
that Judge Qin brought coffee back to the office that day.

00:24:57.766 --> 00:24:58.766
Later on,

00:24:58.767 --> 00:25:00.333
he even spilled it on his documents and asked her to reprint them.

00:25:02.166 --> 00:25:03.166
What do you think, Madam?

00:25:06.033 --> 00:25:07.400
Everything is too perfect.

00:25:07.966 --> 00:25:09.333
It doesn't seem real.

00:25:11.733 --> 00:25:12.733
Let's go back and discuss this.

00:25:23.166 --> 00:25:24.166
Dad.

00:25:25.466 --> 00:25:26.666
Did you make them pay back...

00:25:28.033 --> 00:25:29.600
what they owe us?

00:25:35.433 --> 00:25:36.733
Don't think about that.

00:25:37.366 --> 00:25:38.366
Don't worry.

00:25:40.066 --> 00:25:42.233
Just take care of yourself in there.

00:25:43.366 --> 00:25:44.366
Okay?

00:27:01.766 --> 00:27:02.766
Father.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.800
Didn't you make a composite sketch for the police?

00:27:05.733 --> 00:27:06.833
Make one for us too.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.400
A life for a life.

00:27:09.633 --> 00:27:12.533
I'm sure God will agree.

00:28:00.933 --> 00:28:02.200
Judge Qin's car was vandalized.

00:28:02.866 --> 00:28:04.033
- I wonder who did it. - Here he comes.

00:28:07.733 --> 00:28:08.733
Judge Qin.

00:28:08.734 --> 00:28:09.932
- Judge Qin! - Judge Qin!

00:28:09.933 --> 00:28:11.399
Your car was vandalized last night.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.933
- Do you know who did it? - Excuse me.

00:28:13.066 --> 00:28:14.066
Judge Qin.

00:28:14.067 --> 00:28:15.132
Don't you think this is a sign...

00:28:15.133 --> 00:28:16.266
that the public order in Hokong is getting worse?

00:28:17.833 --> 00:28:19.432
Actually, the public order in Hokong...

00:28:19.433 --> 00:28:21.033
has been bad for a long time.

00:28:21.466 --> 00:28:22.666
If the police keep ignoring the fact...

00:28:22.966 --> 00:28:25.266
that the rule of law is being threatened by violence,

00:28:25.633 --> 00:28:27.666
this kind of situation will continue to happen.

00:28:28.033 --> 00:28:29.033
In fact,

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.566
it will get worse.

00:28:31.433 --> 00:28:32.466
I'm not afraid of the underworld forces.

00:28:33.233 --> 00:28:34.800
I'm also prepared to sacrifice myself...

00:28:34.933 --> 00:28:36.600
for the rule of law.

00:28:39.866 --> 00:28:40.866
Judge Qin.

00:28:41.166 --> 00:28:42.732
A councilor named Huang Xiao is here.

00:28:42.733 --> 00:28:43.766
He wants to see you.

00:28:49.666 --> 00:28:50.666
Let him in.

00:28:52.533 --> 00:28:53.800
Councilor Huang, please come in.

00:28:55.133 --> 00:28:56.133
Hello, Councilor Huang.

00:28:56.433 --> 00:28:57.433
Hello, Judge Qin.

00:28:57.733 --> 00:28:58.866
I especially came to visit you...

00:28:59.033 --> 00:29:00.133
because of what happened last night.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.800
Thank you. Have a seat.

00:29:02.133 --> 00:29:03.133
Okay.

00:29:07.333 --> 00:29:08.400
As a councilor,

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.533
the citizens are not my only concern.

00:29:10.866 --> 00:29:11.965
I also value...

00:29:11.966 --> 00:29:13.333
the core values of Hokong.

00:29:14.066 --> 00:29:15.532
Economic development and the rule of law...

00:29:15.533 --> 00:29:16.766
are closely related.

00:29:16.866 --> 00:29:18.266
If the rule of law is destroyed,

00:29:18.666 --> 00:29:21.066
I'm afraid the investors will lose faith in us.

00:29:21.633 --> 00:29:23.800
So I have absolutely no tolerance...

00:29:24.233 --> 00:29:25.233
for the violence you've experienced.

00:29:26.233 --> 00:29:28.233
Ever since my son was sentenced to prison,

00:29:28.666 --> 00:29:30.733
I've been subjected to a lot of verbal abuse.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.100
Recently,

00:29:32.101 --> 00:29:33.600
it has even escalated to real destruction.

00:29:34.766 --> 00:29:35.866
What worries me the most...

00:29:36.033 --> 00:29:38.266
is my son's safety in prison.

00:29:39.033 --> 00:29:40.400
I understand how you feel.

00:29:40.966 --> 00:29:41.966
Judge Qin.

00:29:42.133 --> 00:29:43.332
I'm on the Supervision Committee...

00:29:43.333 --> 00:29:44.633
of the Correctional Services Department.

00:29:45.333 --> 00:29:46.833
Why don't I talk to the warden?

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
I'll ask him to pay special attention...

00:29:48.001 --> 00:29:49.433
to your son's safety.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.800
Would you be able to do that?

00:29:51.933 --> 00:29:52.933
No problem.

00:29:56.133 --> 00:29:57.133
Here.

00:29:58.533 --> 00:29:59.533
Hello, sir.

00:29:59.566 --> 00:30:00.666
I'm Councilor Huang Xiao.

00:30:01.466 --> 00:30:02.466
Hello, Councilor Huang.

00:30:02.533 --> 00:30:04.132
Last night, Judge Qin's car...

00:30:04.133 --> 00:30:05.166
was vandalized.

00:30:05.566 --> 00:30:07.133
I'm sure you've seen the news.

00:30:07.233 --> 00:30:08.233
Yes, I did.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.865
I think this is definitely...

00:30:09.866 --> 00:30:11.533
a targeted act of violence.

00:30:12.133 --> 00:30:14.200
I'm worried that Judge Qin's son, Qin Yi Wei,

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.333
will be the next target.

00:30:17.133 --> 00:30:18.465
Can you do something...

00:30:18.466 --> 00:30:20.066
to guarantee his son's safety?

00:30:21.133 --> 00:30:22.165
Don't worry, Councilor Huang.

00:30:22.166 --> 00:30:23.532
I know what to do.

00:30:23.533 --> 00:30:24.765
I guarantee that Qin Yi Wei...

00:30:24.766 --> 00:30:26.033
won't be harmed.

00:30:28.533 --> 00:30:29.533
Thank you, sir.

00:30:30.033 --> 00:30:31.433
I'll be in touch. Bye.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.600
Judge Qin.

00:30:34.766 --> 00:30:36.233
The warden has agreed.

00:30:36.533 --> 00:30:37.766
That should put your mind at ease.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Thank you, Councilor Huang.

00:30:39.366 --> 00:30:40.366
Don't mention it.

00:30:40.566 --> 00:30:42.132
If anything happens in the future,

00:30:42.133 --> 00:30:43.333
feel free to contact me.

00:30:43.633 --> 00:30:44.999
I predict we'll have a lot of chances to cooperate...

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.366
in the future.

00:30:47.966 --> 00:30:49.000
Okay, I'll let you get back to work.

00:30:49.266 --> 00:30:50.266
Okay, this way, please.

00:30:50.266 --> 00:30:51.266
Okay.

00:30:55.733 --> 00:30:56.733
Bye.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:57.800
Bye.

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:20.933
Judge Qin.

00:31:21.966 --> 00:31:23.066
Did your car break down?

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.600
Yes, the tire suddenly went flat.

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.133
It's hard to get a cab at this hour.

00:31:29.433 --> 00:31:30.632
If you don't mind,

00:31:30.633 --> 00:31:31.633
I'll give you a ride.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.033
Thank you.

00:31:43.633 --> 00:31:44.666
What's your name?

00:31:46.166 --> 00:31:47.233
Which department are you from?

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.133
I brought you here today...

00:32:01.233 --> 00:32:02.733
to sacrifice you to my brother.

00:32:08.633 --> 00:32:09.833
Don't you know that the maximum sentence...

00:32:10.366 --> 00:32:11.866
for kidnapping is 15 years?

00:32:13.133 --> 00:32:14.466
You're quite filial.

00:32:14.833 --> 00:32:16.400
Do you want to keep your dad company in jail?

00:32:18.433 --> 00:32:19.933
Kidnapping gets me 15 years.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.033
Then what about murder?

00:32:23.433 --> 00:32:24.833
How will you pay for killing my brother?

00:32:25.933 --> 00:32:27.000
How do you want to settle this?

00:32:27.866 --> 00:32:29.200
Why did you kill my brother?

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.633
Do I need a reason?

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.400
I'll ask you again.

00:32:37.133 --> 00:32:38.400
Why did you kill my brother?

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.233
Because your brother is scum.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.400
Your whole family is scum.

00:32:57.233 --> 00:32:58.233
Why?

00:32:59.133 --> 00:33:00.133
Why?

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.232
Why did you kill my brother?

00:33:02.233 --> 00:33:04.000
Why did you kill my brother? Why?

00:33:06.133 --> 00:33:07.133
Are you going to tell me or not?

00:33:08.433 --> 00:33:09.433
You're not going to tell me?

00:33:10.233 --> 00:33:11.366
Then I'll kill you.

00:33:12.166 --> 00:33:13.433
I'll kill your son too.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:32.600
Get up!

00:33:38.266 --> 00:33:40.033
If I walk out of this door alive,

00:33:41.366 --> 00:33:42.565
I'll kill you too.

00:33:42.566 --> 00:33:43.633
You're quite noble.

00:33:44.333 --> 00:33:45.633
Without your judicial robe,

00:33:46.566 --> 00:33:47.600
you're nothing.

00:33:52.233 --> 00:33:53.233
Don't shoot.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:54.800
I'll tell you.

00:33:55.066 --> 00:33:56.066
I'll tell you.

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.433
It's because your whole family deserves to die.

00:34:05.633 --> 00:34:07.633
Then I'll kill you to avenge my brother.

00:34:08.133 --> 00:34:09.133
Okay.

00:34:09.233 --> 00:34:11.066
If you have the guts, shoot me!

00:34:11.266 --> 00:34:12.266
Come on!

00:34:13.633 --> 00:34:14.633
Young Master Lie.

00:34:15.233 --> 00:34:16.233
What is it?

00:34:16.966 --> 00:34:17.966
Someone is here.

00:34:18.133 --> 00:34:19.133
You must meet him.

00:34:31.433 --> 00:34:32.433
Keep an eye on him.

00:34:32.733 --> 00:34:33.733
Yes.

00:34:47.166 --> 00:34:48.166
Young Master Lie.

00:34:49.833 --> 00:34:51.600
This is Councilor Huang Xiao.

00:34:53.166 --> 00:34:54.166
Councilor Huang.

00:34:54.833 --> 00:34:56.233
I don't think we've come across each other much.

00:34:56.833 --> 00:34:57.833
What is it?

00:34:59.433 --> 00:35:01.666
I'm deeply saddened by your brother's passing.

00:35:02.333 --> 00:35:03.466
I came to offer my condolences.

00:35:03.833 --> 00:35:04.966
Thank you for your concern.

00:35:06.433 --> 00:35:07.533
Let's go somewhere and talk.

00:35:09.966 --> 00:35:10.966
Today?

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
I can't.

00:35:21.533 --> 00:35:22.533
Councilor Huang.

00:35:27.133 --> 00:35:28.133
This way.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.066
I guess you're not here to offer your condolences.

00:35:32.766 --> 00:35:33.766
Why don't you...

00:35:35.166 --> 00:35:36.166
just get to the point?

00:35:37.733 --> 00:35:39.800
I love talking to smart people like you.

00:35:40.033 --> 00:35:41.166
It saves me a lot of time.

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.633
I want you to let Judge Qin go.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.199
Hokong needs a judge...

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.933
who stands up for justice.

00:35:49.133 --> 00:35:50.266
Stand up for justice?

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.266
What if I don't let him go?

00:35:54.966 --> 00:35:56.199
Even if Judge Qin dies,

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.600
your brother won't come back to life.

00:35:58.433 --> 00:35:59.466
Why don't you...

00:35:59.733 --> 00:36:01.233
do something meaningful?

00:36:06.166 --> 00:36:07.266
There are certain symbols...

00:36:07.733 --> 00:36:09.200
that you must be careful of when you see them.

00:36:10.233 --> 00:36:11.233
Diamonds,

00:36:12.166 --> 00:36:13.166
hearts,

00:36:15.166 --> 00:36:16.166
and spades.

00:36:17.166 --> 00:36:18.166
Businessmen,

00:36:18.566 --> 00:36:19.566
policemen,

00:36:19.733 --> 00:36:20.733
and politicians.

00:36:21.533 --> 00:36:22.533
You have to be careful...

00:36:23.166 --> 00:36:24.166
when you see them.

00:36:24.633 --> 00:36:26.000
They only care about their own interests.

00:36:34.766 --> 00:36:35.800
I don't think...

00:36:35.833 --> 00:36:37.233
we can convince each other.

00:36:38.033 --> 00:36:39.233
Let's not waste time.

00:36:40.166 --> 00:36:41.166
Second Master Han.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.600
The time we're wasting...

00:36:43.133 --> 00:36:44.833
is your dad's time in prison.

00:36:47.733 --> 00:36:48.733
What do you mean?

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.833
It's like a game of chess.

00:36:52.966 --> 00:36:54.666
Every chess piece has its own function.

00:36:55.566 --> 00:36:56.933
You can't freely move them.

00:36:57.733 --> 00:36:58.765
If you do,

00:36:58.766 --> 00:37:00.233
it will affect the entire setup.

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.566
As a result, that will affect the outcome of the game.

00:37:04.033 --> 00:37:05.233
If the outcome is affected,

00:37:05.433 --> 00:37:07.133
it will affect our interests.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.033
You understand, don't you?

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.200
Who is the mastermind of this game?

00:37:17.166 --> 00:37:18.166
You?

00:37:19.333 --> 00:37:21.233
I'm just the messenger.

00:37:22.033 --> 00:37:23.033
In other words,

00:37:24.033 --> 00:37:25.033
my dad...

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.233
is a pawn.

00:37:26.833 --> 00:37:27.833
That's right.

00:37:28.166 --> 00:37:29.833
And the judge is a pawn too?

00:37:30.766 --> 00:37:31.766
He will be.

00:37:32.566 --> 00:37:34.333
How do you know he'll listen to you?

00:37:35.633 --> 00:37:37.633
Everyone has their weaknesses.

00:37:38.633 --> 00:37:40.266
I'm not asking him to listen to me.

00:37:40.733 --> 00:37:41.833
It's for the greater good.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.166
The benefits of the greater good...

00:37:44.533 --> 00:37:46.266
will also benefit your dad in the future.

00:37:51.833 --> 00:37:53.000
I know my dad too well.

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.400
No benefit...

00:37:55.966 --> 00:37:57.000
could compare to my brother.

00:37:58.233 --> 00:37:59.233
It's the same for me.

00:38:02.233 --> 00:38:03.366
That's too bad.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:05.800
A useless pawn...

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.200
is worthless.

00:38:11.233 --> 00:38:12.833
Don't you dare touch my dad.

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.800
I'm just the messenger.

00:38:18.833 --> 00:38:20.133
I've delivered the message.

00:38:20.966 --> 00:38:22.066
Think about it.

00:38:54.233 --> 00:38:55.233
Judge Qin.

00:38:56.133 --> 00:38:57.833
Councilor Huang would like you to get in the car.

00:39:12.666 --> 00:39:13.666
Judge Qin.

00:39:14.166 --> 00:39:15.166
Councilor Hwang.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Get in.

00:39:27.766 --> 00:39:28.766
Thank you.

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.433
How did you know I was here?

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.032
I was told...

00:39:39.033 --> 00:39:40.065
that you were in trouble,

00:39:40.066 --> 00:39:41.200
so I came to take a look.

00:39:43.033 --> 00:39:45.733
After all, you're an important person in Hokong.

00:39:48.966 --> 00:39:50.265
As a councilor,

00:39:50.266 --> 00:39:51.566
we're the bridge of communication.

00:39:52.333 --> 00:39:53.465
I know very well...

00:39:53.466 --> 00:39:54.466
what happened.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.200
Judge Qin.

00:40:00.566 --> 00:40:02.733
Why don't we pretend nothing happened tonight?

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.132
I also believe...

00:40:05.133 --> 00:40:06.733
it won't happen again.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.200
Let me take you home to get some rest.

00:40:17.833 --> 00:40:18.833
Thank you.

00:40:25.933 --> 00:40:27.833
Why didn't you kill the judge?

00:40:29.033 --> 00:40:30.200
Councilor Huang came.

00:40:31.333 --> 00:40:33.000
He said for the sake of Hokong's prosperity,

00:40:33.966 --> 00:40:34.966
I must let him go.

00:40:36.833 --> 00:40:38.133
Did you let that scare you?

00:40:40.966 --> 00:40:41.966
Dad.

00:40:42.166 --> 00:40:43.433
You said it yourself.

00:40:43.733 --> 00:40:45.233
We can only talk about self-interest with those people.

00:40:45.433 --> 00:40:47.032
Interest is the most powerful weapon.

00:40:47.033 --> 00:40:48.233
Your brother...

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.165
Your brother is my only interest!

00:40:50.166 --> 00:40:51.433
Nothing else matters!

00:40:57.533 --> 00:40:58.566
A useless pawn...

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.000
is worthless.

00:41:00.233 --> 00:41:01.800
Don't you dare touch my dad.

00:41:03.666 --> 00:41:05.166
I've delivered the message.

00:41:05.766 --> 00:41:06.966
Think about it.

00:41:10.233 --> 00:41:11.233
Dad.

00:41:11.766 --> 00:41:13.833
That judge won't abandon his son and run away.

00:41:14.233 --> 00:41:15.733
We can kill him anytime.

00:41:16.966 --> 00:41:18.299
But I won't give them...

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:19.300
any excuse to hurt you.

00:41:19.301 --> 00:41:20.400
I'm not afraid of them.

00:41:21.466 --> 00:41:23.400
I don't believe they dare to hurt me!

00:41:24.433 --> 00:41:25.733
I can help them,

00:41:25.933 --> 00:41:27.233
but I can also oppose them!

00:41:27.866 --> 00:41:29.433
Let's see who's afraid of whom.

00:41:33.166 --> 00:41:34.800
- Dad. - Okay, Xiao Lie. That's enough.

00:41:34.933 --> 00:41:35.933
Go out first.

00:41:43.833 --> 00:41:45.366
I'll definitely avenge Han Gang.

00:41:46.666 --> 00:41:48.000
I won't let you down.

00:41:56.166 --> 00:41:57.600
Don't be so angry.

00:42:00.366 --> 00:42:01.766
I remember you told me...

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.566
that the hardest criminal for the police to catch...

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:05.766
is a police officer who breaks the law.

00:42:06.566 --> 00:42:07.566
Similarly,

00:42:07.733 --> 00:42:08.833
catching a judge...

00:42:09.066 --> 00:42:10.966
who knowingly breaks the law...

00:42:11.733 --> 00:42:12.733
is even harder.

00:42:12.766 --> 00:42:14.332
That's because no one knows the legal process...

00:42:14.333 --> 00:42:15.766
and how to use loopholes in the law...

00:42:15.966 --> 00:42:17.200
better than he does.

00:42:18.233 --> 00:42:19.365
He'll definitely be harder to catch...

00:42:19.366 --> 00:42:21.033
than a police officer who breaks the law.

00:42:22.233 --> 00:42:24.166
If you put it that way,

00:42:25.233 --> 00:42:27.933
you'll be facing a very difficult challenge.

00:42:29.733 --> 00:42:31.133
His alibi...

00:42:31.366 --> 00:42:32.366
is too perfect.

00:42:33.433 --> 00:42:34.433
I've thought about it.

00:42:34.666 --> 00:42:37.033
He could've put his ring there in advance.

00:42:37.233 --> 00:42:39.232
He could've also planned everything else in advance.

00:42:39.233 --> 00:42:40.233
Hey, what about the witness?

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.332
That Mr. Fei...

00:42:42.333 --> 00:42:43.733
is his alibi witness, right?

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:45.599
He couldn't have bought coffee...

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:46.833
while killing someone at the same time, right?

00:42:47.966 --> 00:42:50.000
That's what I don't get.

00:42:52.233 --> 00:42:53.966
I'm sorry. I'm talking about work again.

00:42:55.666 --> 00:42:57.333
Why don't we go watch a movie?

00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.732
I should be the one apologizing.

00:42:59.733 --> 00:43:01.433
I need to visit Liu Mao after lunch.

00:43:02.233 --> 00:43:03.233
You're going to Tuncheng?

00:43:03.266 --> 00:43:04.266
No.

00:43:04.267 --> 00:43:05.632
After he agreed to have the surgery,

00:43:05.633 --> 00:43:06.966
I got someone to bring him here.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.832
As long as there's even a slim chance of survival,

00:43:09.833 --> 00:43:11.633
no one would want to lie there and wait for death.

00:43:13.433 --> 00:43:15.132
Well, I hope...

00:43:15.133 --> 00:43:16.166
he can really give you new leads.

00:43:17.033 --> 00:43:18.033
I hope so.

00:43:18.966 --> 00:43:20.232
I'll see what time I get back.

00:43:20.233 --> 00:43:21.332
If there's time,

00:43:21.333 --> 00:43:22.333
let's go and watch a movie.

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:24.600
All right.

00:43:30.433 --> 00:43:32.333
The patient will fall asleep soon after taking medication.

00:43:32.566 --> 00:43:33.633
Don't chat for too long.

00:43:34.033 --> 00:43:35.033
Okay.

00:43:37.933 --> 00:43:39.033
Are you all right, Liu Mao?

00:43:39.733 --> 00:43:41.366
I'm not in pain anymore after taking my medication.

00:43:41.733 --> 00:43:42.766
Thank you for your concern.

00:43:43.733 --> 00:43:44.733
Liu Mao.

00:43:45.333 --> 00:43:46.399
Do you still remember...

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:47.400
who Lin Qian is?

00:43:48.866 --> 00:43:49.866
She's in Hokong too.

00:43:49.867 --> 00:43:51.133
She said she'll come and visit you later.

00:43:53.633 --> 00:43:54.633
I know...

00:43:55.133 --> 00:43:56.466
this is my punishment.

00:43:56.933 --> 00:43:58.233
I've let the Wooden Shed Area down.

00:44:00.833 --> 00:44:01.833
Stone.

00:44:02.566 --> 00:44:04.833
I know why you came to see me.

00:44:05.966 --> 00:44:07.333
It's for your family.

00:44:08.966 --> 00:44:10.733
The person who took the fall back then...

00:44:11.466 --> 00:44:12.533
wasn't the real culprit.

00:44:13.833 --> 00:44:15.066
Do you know who the real culprit is?

00:44:15.333 --> 00:44:16.433
I saw it from behind.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.533
It was a tall man.

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:20.733
The one who took the blame...

00:44:20.966 --> 00:44:21.966
is short in stature...

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000
and malnourished.

00:44:27.433 --> 00:44:28.433
Officer Shi.

00:44:28.466 --> 00:44:30.399
This is the case file for the arson case...

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:31.833
in the Huyan Wooden Shed Area in 1978.

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:35.965
So all the evidence and statements are in here?

00:44:35.966 --> 00:44:37.400
Yes, they were all recorded in here.

00:44:39.366 --> 00:44:40.866
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

00:44:58.733 --> 00:45:00.566
He's only 5'6".

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.633
He doesn't fit that build at all.

00:45:05.166 --> 00:45:06.365
No wonder Liu Mao insisted...

00:45:06.366 --> 00:45:07.533
that he was the scapegoat.

00:45:16.066 --> 00:45:18.566
(Attendees: Prosecutor Qin Yu)

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:35.800
You're home.

00:45:37.266 --> 00:45:38.366
It looks like...

00:45:38.533 --> 00:45:40.132
you've decided to move your office...

00:45:40.133 --> 00:45:41.633
to my house.

00:45:45.633 --> 00:45:46.633
Yes.

00:45:46.933 --> 00:45:48.333
What? Do you have a problem with that?

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:49.965
No, I don't.

00:45:49.966 --> 00:45:51.433
That's great.

00:45:52.066 --> 00:45:53.066
Have you eaten?

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.932
Not yet. I was waiting for you.

00:45:55.933 --> 00:45:57.132
Okay, I'll cook.

00:45:57.133 --> 00:45:58.133
What do you want to eat?

00:45:58.166 --> 00:46:00.533
Why don't I cook for you today?

00:46:00.966 --> 00:46:02.765
I haven't cooked for you...

00:46:02.766 --> 00:46:04.766
since I made you rice in winter melon soup last time.

00:46:05.033 --> 00:46:07.265
Hey, wait. Are you sure...

00:46:07.266 --> 00:46:08.665
that yellow stuff you cooked...

00:46:08.666 --> 00:46:09.865
was rice in winter melon soup?

00:46:09.866 --> 00:46:10.866
What?

00:46:10.966 --> 00:46:12.466
Just think of it as rice in pumpkin soup.

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:14.932
Go and investigate.

00:46:14.933 --> 00:46:15.933
I'll cook.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.565
There's no need to trouble you, okay?

00:46:17.566 --> 00:46:18.599
No.

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:19.932
I want to make...

00:46:19.933 --> 00:46:22.032
homemade seafood soup with puff pastry for you.

00:46:22.033 --> 00:46:23.400
You want to make puff pastry?

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.232
Here. Take a look...

00:46:28.233 --> 00:46:29.833
at what rice in winter melon soup actually looks like.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:32.600
So it's supposed to be this color.

00:46:35.033 --> 00:46:36.033
So?

00:46:36.233 --> 00:46:37.233
What new leads did you get...

00:46:37.234 --> 00:46:39.000
after meeting with Liu Mao today?

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.565
Based on the information he provided...

00:46:44.566 --> 00:46:46.833
and the evidence I found in the trial folder,

00:46:47.233 --> 00:46:48.832
the 5'6" killer...

00:46:48.833 --> 00:46:50.033
must have been a scapegoat.

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:51.600
According to Liu Mao,

00:46:51.601 --> 00:46:53.132
the real arsonist he saw...

00:46:53.133 --> 00:46:54.432
was a tall man.

00:46:54.433 --> 00:46:55.433
That's all?

00:46:56.033 --> 00:46:57.033
How are you going to investigate?

00:46:58.166 --> 00:46:59.966
There is one person who can help me.

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:04.233
This person was the prosecutor of the first trial.

00:47:06.966 --> 00:47:07.966
Qin Yu?

00:47:09.966 --> 00:47:11.700
The prosecutor of the first trial had access...

00:47:11.733 --> 00:47:12.965
the most comprehensive evidence...

00:47:12.966 --> 00:47:14.233
from the beginning of the case.

00:47:14.966 --> 00:47:15.966
In other words, they could be...

00:47:15.967 --> 00:47:18.232
the most authentic evidence and statements...

00:47:18.233 --> 00:47:20.233
before the scapegoat and fabricated evidence appeared.

00:47:21.066 --> 00:47:22.066
Was it really Qin Yu?

00:47:27.233 --> 00:47:28.233
Hey.

00:47:28.733 --> 00:47:29.865
I'm asking the murder suspect...

00:47:29.866 --> 00:47:32.332
that you're investigating for help.

00:47:32.333 --> 00:47:33.333
Will you be mad at me?

00:47:34.966 --> 00:47:36.133
They're separate matters.

00:47:37.433 --> 00:47:38.433
I'm just worried...

00:47:38.866 --> 00:47:40.400
that he's no longer the Qin Yu he used to be.

00:47:41.033 --> 00:47:42.233
He might not help you.

00:47:44.433 --> 00:47:45.633
I have to try anyway.

00:47:51.833 --> 00:47:52.833
Good morning, Judge Qin.

00:47:54.133 --> 00:47:55.133
Good morning.

00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.432
I know this is a bit sudden, but...

00:47:57.433 --> 00:47:59.333
if it's not too much trouble, can I have a word with you?

00:48:02.233 --> 00:48:04.400
Judge Qin, please take a look at this photocopy.

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:07.332
The Huyan Wooden Shed Area arson case?

00:48:07.333 --> 00:48:08.333
That's right.

00:48:08.933 --> 00:48:11.233
You were the prosecutor in the first trial.

00:48:11.433 --> 00:48:12.865
I know the prosecutor suddenly changed...

00:48:12.866 --> 00:48:13.966
right before the trial,

00:48:14.233 --> 00:48:16.166
but you must've seen the documents for the first trial.

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:18.800
That's right.

00:48:18.833 --> 00:48:19.833
Back then,

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.833
I read the case briefly.

00:48:23.033 --> 00:48:25.166
Did you notice anything strange about it?

00:48:29.966 --> 00:48:31.400
It's a case from 1978.

00:48:32.033 --> 00:48:33.366
I don't remember it clearly.

00:48:36.733 --> 00:48:39.065
Judge Qin, you said you don't remember it clearly,

00:48:39.066 --> 00:48:41.532
but you clearly remember...

00:48:41.533 --> 00:48:42.633
that the case happened in 1978.

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:56.366
All right, well...

00:48:56.833 --> 00:48:57.866
Thank you, Judge Qin.

00:48:58.166 --> 00:48:59.166
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

00:49:04.333 --> 00:49:05.333
Come in.

00:49:07.033 --> 00:49:08.033
Officer Da, did you want to see me?

00:49:09.566 --> 00:49:11.633
I think this Panamanian coffee...

00:49:11.966 --> 00:49:12.966
is pretty good.

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:15.832
Come, sit down and try it.

00:49:15.833 --> 00:49:16.833
Okay.

00:49:18.466 --> 00:49:19.466
Thank you.

00:49:26.566 --> 00:49:27.566
I heard...

00:49:27.666 --> 00:49:30.366
that you're interested in some old cases lately.

00:49:33.066 --> 00:49:34.266
I'm just learning from the past.

00:49:35.033 --> 00:49:36.965
Technology wasn't that advanced back then.

00:49:36.966 --> 00:49:37.966
On the contrary,

00:49:37.967 --> 00:49:39.533
that meant investigative techniques were very important.

00:49:39.933 --> 00:49:41.433
Those cases are closed.

00:49:41.966 --> 00:49:43.166
There's no point in using them as references.

00:49:43.433 --> 00:49:44.633
Times have changed.

00:49:45.333 --> 00:49:46.733
Of course, the way we handle cases...

00:49:47.133 --> 00:49:48.133
is different.

00:49:48.633 --> 00:49:49.800
There's no right and wrong.

00:49:50.366 --> 00:49:52.566
Let bygones be bygones.

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:55.332
As you Chinese say,

00:49:55.333 --> 00:49:56.566
don't judge someone until the coffin is closed.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.066
If you keep digging,

00:49:59.466 --> 00:50:00.600
it'll bring bad luck.

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:03.600
Actually, back then,

00:50:03.733 --> 00:50:05.766
you asked me why I wouldn't tell you the truth.

00:50:06.033 --> 00:50:07.033
It's because...

00:50:07.933 --> 00:50:09.066
I was paid to keep quiet.

00:50:10.733 --> 00:50:11.733
Then...

00:50:12.366 --> 00:50:13.366
who paid you?

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:14.600
I don't know him.

00:50:14.633 --> 00:50:15.633
He said...

00:50:15.733 --> 00:50:17.233
that he was just a messenger.

00:50:17.566 --> 00:50:18.765
After I got the money,

00:50:18.766 --> 00:50:19.933
I went out to take a look.

00:50:20.233 --> 00:50:21.800
He was standing by a car.

00:50:22.233 --> 00:50:23.233
He was talking...

00:50:23.366 --> 00:50:25.533
to a tall foreigner.

00:50:26.233 --> 00:50:27.733
The foreigner was smoking a cigar.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.733
I guess he was a big shot.

00:50:32.433 --> 00:50:33.600
You've been in the force...

00:50:33.833 --> 00:50:34.833
for so many years.

00:50:35.533 --> 00:50:37.133
Your achievements are obvious.

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:38.300
I plan...

00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:39.633
to recommend you for promotion at the end of the year.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.366
How does Deputy Superintendent sound?

00:50:48.933 --> 00:50:50.432
In that case, Officer Da,

00:50:50.433 --> 00:50:52.066
I must thank you for your recommendation.

00:50:52.566 --> 00:50:54.166
Don't mention it.

00:50:54.733 --> 00:50:55.733
From now on,

00:50:56.033 --> 00:50:58.400
do things for the greater good.

00:50:58.866 --> 00:51:00.000
Avoid any cases...

00:51:00.133 --> 00:51:01.332
that are too troublesome...

00:51:01.333 --> 00:51:02.600
and provide no benefit to you.

00:51:02.933 --> 00:51:04.199
Then the deputy superintendent position...

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:06.200
will definitely be yours.

00:51:06.633 --> 00:51:08.133
I won't let you down.

00:51:10.966 --> 00:51:13.000
I suspected whether Da Gama was a corrupt cop or not.

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:15.000
I don't have to wonder anymore.

00:51:17.033 --> 00:51:19.466
Da Gama has always indulged Han Kui Long.

00:51:20.366 --> 00:51:22.032
Is Han Kui Long...

00:51:22.033 --> 00:51:23.033
the one who's colluding with?

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.800
I don't think Han Kui Long is the only one.

00:51:26.866 --> 00:51:27.932
I think there's someone higher up...

00:51:27.933 --> 00:51:29.400
behind Da Gama.

00:51:31.133 --> 00:51:32.333
What are you going to do now?

00:51:34.133 --> 00:51:35.133
I'm going to do...

00:51:35.133 --> 00:51:36.133
what a police officer has to do.

00:51:38.233 --> 00:51:39.632
Da Gama knows...

00:51:39.633 --> 00:51:41.466
you're reinvestigating the arson case.

00:51:42.433 --> 00:51:43.799
Did he always have someone...

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.466
keeping an eye on you?

00:51:48.533 --> 00:51:50.533
He even tried to bribe me.

00:51:51.066 --> 00:51:52.332
I don't think he knows...

00:51:52.333 --> 00:51:53.399
that he's the one...

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:54.400
I'm going to investigate next.

00:51:57.266 --> 00:51:58.266
Then Liu Mao...

00:51:58.566 --> 00:52:00.266
will be your best witness.

00:52:06.666 --> 00:52:07.666
So many innocent lives...

00:52:08.233 --> 00:52:09.666
have been sacrificed...

00:52:09.966 --> 00:52:11.366
just for their benefit.
