00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.830
Seo Jong Hui?

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.050
What's the matter? Is something wrong-

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.930
Oppa.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.610
Please...

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.530
help me.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.750
This is the last train to Seoul.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.590
Thank you, Oppa.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.750
Take it with you.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.450
The night air is cold.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.490
You've got nothing on you.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.390
Aren't you going to ask...

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.790
what happened?

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.665
Most things have cause and effect,

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:48.115
but it's better not to know the cause sometimes.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.450
I'm sorry. This is all I have.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.140
Thank you, Oppa.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.910
I'll never forget...

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.680
your help today.

[Room 948]

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:26.730
Hey. Did anyone here clean Room 948 today?

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.050
Well...

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.860
there was a "Do Not Disturb"
sign hanging on the door.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.380
Gosh, that's so unsettling.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.700
All of you, keep a close watch for now.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.000
It's been four days since check-in,
and they haven't come out at all.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.620
Without room service, they're
probably skipping meals as well.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.190
You're all aware, right?

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.100
For a hotel, the ones who come alone
and shut themselves in are the scariest.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.070
If someone ends up dead,
our necks are on the line, too.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.070
What's going on? So scary...

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.550
Gosh, it's so scary.

[Thank you for everything. Thanks for caring.]

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.030
Excuse me.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.070
Excuse me. Is anyone inside?

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.710
Excuse me! Open the door! Excuse me!

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.160
Team Leader, I need the spare
key to Room 948. Hurry!

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:30.760
Excuse me!

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.490
- Ma'am!
- Stay away.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.730
Please don't come near me.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.330
Please calm down.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.950
Please stay back. Please...

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:44.340
All right.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.540
I won't come closer.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.940
Do whatever you can to stop that guest.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.440
I'll call 119*. Got it?
(Emergency services in Korea)

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:57.700
It's me.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.540
The one who left the note.

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:08.670
When I was little,

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.650
both of my parents died in an accident.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.820
Back then, it really felt like the world had ended.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.850
Life felt like a punishment,

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.380
and there were more miserable
days than happy ones.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.370
But I'm still here. Holding on.

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.660
Hoping this misery will pass.

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.550
So...

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.030
please don't give up.

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:49.430
In the end, it will pass. All of it.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.430
It'll pass, sure.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.630
Gradually get duller.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.910
My late daughter will fade from my memory, too.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.900
I don't want that.

00:09:08.845 --> 00:09:12.120
I want to hurry up and go meet her.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.300
I miss her so much.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.330
- So much.
- But if you do that,

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.940
would your daughter be happy to see you?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.950
I wouldn't if it were me.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.230
I'd just be heartbroken.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:33.530
Knowing my mom took her own life because of me.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:47.490
Your daughter would want you to have a good life.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.990
Be happy enough for both of you.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.240
To see flowers in spring,

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.460
endure the summers, and...

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:10.830
to think of her for a moment
when the sky turns crisp in autumn.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.060
Do you really think so? Truly?

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:47.120
All the new arrivals this season are power suits.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.410
My taste runs more classic.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.950
I guess it's the trend.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:54.640
But this style isn't really me, either.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.320
As the economy grows,

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.240
flaunting wealth and power is
bound to become fashionable.

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:07.380
How about trying switching up your style?

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:12.250
How you present your appearance
can shape a person's mind.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.750
You have a more classic line, right?

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.150
Yes.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.950
Oh, my goodness.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:28.900
You look gorgeous.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.970
This style is new to me,
so it feels a bit awkward.

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.780
No. It suits you way better than I expected.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.700
Look.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.480
It's like it was made for her, right?

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.820
Yes, Chairwoman. It looks great on her.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.090
By the way, I didn't realize
you had a second daughter.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.150
She looks just like you.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:48.950
She's really beautiful.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:50.120
Right?

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.450
We're practically twins, aren't we?

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.890
I came to help you shop.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.530
But you bought me way too many things.

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:08.750
The things you got me last time
still have the tags on.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.030
Wear them. Why keep them on display?

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:14.040
I'll buy you more when the
season and trends change.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.630
Wear them while you're pretty.

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:17.590
I already have plenty.

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.900
No. Honestly, it's too much.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:25.980
You're just right, Jong Hui.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.510
Not over the top, and not lacking.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.930
Thanks to you, I've become so stable lately.

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:38.370
Sometimes, I even think
my Seung Yeon sent you to me.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.390
I'm happy, too.

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:44.450
Thanks to you, I get to shop at a department store

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:47.190
and have tea in a place this lovely.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:51.210
If it weren't for you, when would
I ever enjoy such luxury?

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:52.970
Which brings me to ask,

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:56.400
why don't you just stay with me like this?

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.540
Sorry?

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.930
I'm proposing to you right now.

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:05.040
Would you be my daughter? My adopted daughter?

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.220
I just had the wallpaper redone.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.690
I don't know if you like it.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.250
It's so pretty.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.730
Really?

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.350
It's gorgeous, but it's my first time
in such a spacious room.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:32.710
When I worked as a bus attendant,

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:36.960
our dorm had a dozen girls in a room
not even half this size.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:46.570
Look…

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:53.060
From now on, I'd rather you didn't
talk about the past.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.670
I'd prefer you didn't stay in contact
with people from the past, either.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:04.040
You're starting a new life with me now.

- Mom.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.060
I don't have much time today.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.900
My class schedule is really tight.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.070
I know. But you can spare an hour, right?

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:47.000
Oh, my. Your daughter is so beautiful.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.250
How should I say this?

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:54.100
From an artist's standpoint,
I'm itching to style her from head to toe.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.440
She's such a perfect model.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.710
Oh, really?

00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:59.690
It may be lip service, but it's nice to hear.

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:03.530
Gosh, Chairwoman, lip service? No way.

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:07.870
I may not look it, but I can't
say things I don't mean.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:13.020
That's why people sometimes say
I'm not cut out to run a business.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.150
Shall we head up?

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:17.020
You'd like to sit side by side, right?

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.480
- Yes.
- Right this way.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.620
Be careful.

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:41.650

Yes?

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.920
My daughter doesn't like looking
overly done, so keep it natural.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.200
Done, but not too done.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.170
She really doesn't like anything flashy.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.400
Understood, Chairwoman.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.980
We'll keep it simple.
No cut. Just a light blowout.

You should've been more careful!

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.440
She has a fear of sharp objects.
She's very sensitive!

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.110
I'm so sorry.

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:47.020
I rarely make a mistake like this.

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.140
Are you okay?

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.060
Y-Yes. I'm fine.

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:53.740
We're so sorry.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.260
I'm so sorry, Chairwoman.
She's usually not like that.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.870
Apologize.

00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.690
I'm sorry.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.190
I'm so sorry. That was startling, wasn't it?

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:08.020
I'm so sorry.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.570
I'm sorry, but...

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:11.400
Yes, go ahead.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.300
I'm sorry, but...

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:20.010
I'd like to have her do the blowout today.
Is that possible?

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:21.410
Sorry?

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.990
Oh, yes! Of course.

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:28.900
Ms. Ko's hands are very skillful.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.530
Ms. Ko?

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:32.000
Yes.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.770
Switch.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:41.590
Then, I'll take care of you today.

If you do this for a few minutes and take it out,

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.510
you get nice curls, just like
you used a curling iron.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.500
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.140
Where'd you learn this?

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.480
My mom's know-how.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:07.320
I'm even thinking of getting
a cosmetology license, just in case.

We're very sorry for startling you earlier.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:49.410
I'll train them properly to prevent
such mishaps in the future.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:52.390
Do you like how it turned out today?

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:54.510
Yes, I like it.

Sure. Good work, everyone.

What did I say is most crucial in sales?

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:18.420
Display. The first law of the show window.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:21.000
In three seconds of looking at a display,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.780
the brand image is burned into a customer's mind.

Look. Don't you want to buy it already?

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.110
Can't you line these up?

I don't have time to spar with you.
Just put her down.

Did Su Jin get her vaccinations?

See? You forgot again, didn't you?

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.480
I asked if she got her second
chickenpox shot last month

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:46.020
and you said to butt out saying
you'd do it this month.

You still haven't?

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.640
I can do it now. I just forgot.

in this rough world?

No matter how I think about it,
that's just not right.

I'll tell the driver.

It's okay. There are still buses running.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.650
I don't think I need it anymore.

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:35.850
I want you to have it.

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:49.760
I really, really missed you.

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:55.560
I even went near your place behind my mom's back.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.990
I couldn't find the house
in the end due to redevelopment.

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:00.540
Me, too.

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:05.050
I really missed you, too.

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:09.540
I just had no idea how to even start looking.

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.030
You didn't even show up in my dreams.

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.590
Really?

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:16.700
Yeah.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.200
You're not getting away now.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:25.010
I've got you again, okay?

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:28.210
Don't you try to run off on me.

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:31.390
I'm not letting you go this time.

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:34.820
Go in and sleep.

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:38.000
- Don't get all worked up and toss and turn.
- Okay.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.230
- I'll go now.
- Bye.

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:42.330
Bye.

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:44.200
Yeong Rye!

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.510
I'll show up in your dream tonight!

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:49.420
See you there!

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:52.860
- I'm off.
- Bye.

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:55.460
Bye!

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:42.600
Yeong Rye, every day feels so long.

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:46.660
I wake up, work, eat just to stay alive.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.590
I beg for sleep that won't come.

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:52.240
And I'm afraid of tomorrow.

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:58.270
Will radiant days like the ones I spent with you

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:00.820
ever come to me again?

00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:15.630
Yeong Rye, a miracle happened to me.

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:19.310
I became a rich family's daughter.

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:23.940
If you'd been with me,
you'd have been so happy for me.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:27.360
I finally have a family who loves me.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:33.860
Today, I craved ramen so badly.

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:37.080
So, I went out and ate it behind Mom's back.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:40.400
But it didn't taste like
it used to on the rooftop.

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:44.760
I don't really miss the ramen…

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.600
but I just miss you so much.

00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:28.550
I had a dream.

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:32.740
That man was chasing me,
blood pouring out of him.

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:37.240
Since I didn't see any news reports,
I guess he didn't die.

00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:39.620
But why didn't he report it?

00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:44.530
I'm still so scared, Yeong Rye.

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:41.790
Sir. Sir, I'm sorry, but could you open the door?

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:43.700
Thank you.

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:11.140
Hey.

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:13.970
What did you just say?

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:15.660
Once I dug out one thing,

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:19.430
the corruption kept coming out like a vine.

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:23.600
You forced innocent attendants
to take the blame for embezzlement,

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:28.740
and meanwhile, the manager has been
fiddling with the books and embezzling?

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:31.250
Over the course of more than ten years?

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:36.400
As if that wasn't enough, you even used
that money to buy off the police.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.950
If HQ finds out- no...

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:40.650
HQ would be the least of your worries.

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:42.410
Hey, Ko Yeong Rye.

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:44.870
What are you trying to get at?

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:54.300
Take that night's incident to your grave.

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:59.840
After all, Jong Hui's action was self-defense.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:05.260
Even if you try to press charges,
I will testify to that to the end.

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:09.910
In the end, you'll be the one
who steps on the landmine.

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:13.490
So...

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:17.110
just bury the whole thing.

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:06.430
Tell me this.

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:10.730
Why do bean sprouts have heads?

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:13.640
How great would it be not to have to trim them?

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:17.910
We're trimming them because
we're making spicy braised monkfish.

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:20.420
The heads actually have more nutrients.

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:21.830
Really?

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:24.140
Do the heads actually have more nutrients?

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:26.830
Nothing goes to waste with bean sprouts.

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:28.080
They're easy to grow,

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:32.620
and both the head and the stem
are full of nutrients.

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:35.360
Like Yeong Rye?

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.820
- What? Our Yeong Rye?
- Yeah.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.790
Yeong Rye's like that, Unni.

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:43.890
Smart, does her work well,

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:46.130
and she's got a good personality, too.

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:49.820
She's a dutiful daughter and treats
her siblings with great devotion.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:55.280
Even that rigid Mr. Han Gi Bok
would drop everything for her.

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:59.050
There's nothing to fault. She's one in a million.

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:01.200
Is that so?

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.970
Which brings me to the point, Unni.

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:08.570
I'll get to the point. What do you
think about our Jae Pil?

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:10.990
That was out of the blue.

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:12.380
Why bring Jae Pil up suddenly?

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:17.030
Honestly, how can a man and
a woman be "just friends"?

00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:18.770
They've known each other for many years.

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:22.470
When they're always together,
there's bound to be something.

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:26.120
Everybody at the hospital already
thinks they're a couple.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:29.070
Well, I suppose you could read it that way.

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:35.490
Hey, this could mess up Yeong Rye's
chances of getting married.

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:37.220
It's not a laughing matter.

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:41.620
We should get them paired up before it's too late.

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:44.240
Well, now that we're talking,

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:47.900
our Jae Pil doesn't lack anything, either.

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:52.910
He's straight-laced, good-looking,
and has a solid job.

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:55.930
It's a strike against him that
his family's business went belly-up.

00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:59.170
That really isn't a deal-breaker.

00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:02.790
But is this something we can decide ourselves?

00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:05.120
They've got to have feelings for each other.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.580
If it's meant to be, they'll end up
together, no matter what.

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:09.940
If it's not, no amount
of pushing will change that.

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:12.610
You can't make a monk shave his own head.

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:15.400
Anyway, you're okay with it, right?

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.110
Okay or not.

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:20.100
Didn't you say you had an
appointment? I think it's about time.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:22.930
Oh, my! How did it get so late?

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:24.730
Oh, no, I'm late. I'm late!

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:26.290
- Go.
- Okay, then.

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:29.880
At any rate, you said okay! Okay it is.

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:37.440
Really?

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:05.400
Ho Suk, put this inside and boil a pot of water.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:06.960
All right.

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.350
Excuse me.

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:10.770
- Welcome. Would you like something to eat?
- Welcome.

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:12.490
No, ma'am.

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:14.770
This is for you.

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.560
Goodbye.

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.540
- Oh, my. What's all that?
- Wait, what...

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.870
What's all that?

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:26.570
- Did you order this?
- Is this really for us?

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:28.540
- I don't know.
- Who sent it?

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.940
- He just left this.
- What is all this?

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:33.320
- Bananas are expensive.
- What is all this?

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.230
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my!

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:38.480
Who sent this?

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:43.240
Would you like something to eat?

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.480
Ho Suk.

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:50.460
Mother.

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:53.060
- W-Who are you?
- Who are you?

00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:55.610
I'm Jong Hui.

00:42:55.610 --> 00:43:00.630
I used to be friends with Yeong Rye
at Cheongah Transportation.

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:03.060
Jong Hui?

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:05.530
The one who used to come to our house?

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:09.110
Yes. That's me. Jong Hui.

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:12.000
Oh, my goodness!

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.320
Aigoo!

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:18.250
It really is you, isn't it?

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:22.280
How have you been all this time?

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.630
Alive or dead, you should've sent word.

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:28.000
Yeong Rye was worried sick about you.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.620
I'm sorry.

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:31.180
I'm so sorry, Mother.

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:33.620
You're alive, so we meet again.

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:35.920
Since you're alive.

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.240
I'm home.

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:39.150
Me, too.

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:50.070
Yeong Bae and Yeong Mi?

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.720
Guys!

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.800
They've grown up, haven't they?

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.600
What? Jong Hui?

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:06.140
Daeyang Group's only daughter
is the same Seo Jong Hui we know?

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:11.870
I'm so shocked that my stomach
twisted up just now.

00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:15.020
At first, I thought I was mistaken, too.

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:19.270
But it really was Jong Hui.

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:22.080
Even hearing it, I still can't believe it.

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:24.660
Gosh, how could Jong Hui…

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:26.350
Goodness.

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:31.140
She said she saved her life and
became her adopted daughter.

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:33.310
Isn't it so dramatic?

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:35.920
So like Seo Jong Hui.

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:40.170
I was so stunned yesterday and
couldn't believe it myself

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:42.590
that I couldn't tell you.

00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:01.340
- Jong Hui!
- Hey. Ko Yeong Rye, you're here?

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:04.700
Jong Hui, what are you doing here?

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:07.970
What's going on?

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:10.130
Oh, my goodness.

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:13.280
Gosh, look who this is.

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:18.790
It's really our Seo Jong Hui.

00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:21.490
Yeah, Unni. It's really me.

00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:23.470
You rotten little brat.

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:26.070
Where the hell have you been all this time?

00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:29.090
I know. I'm sorry.

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:32.080
Hey, you're here?

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:33.400
Hey.

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:38.310
I told her to stay upstairs,
but she insisted on helping out.

00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:40.770
You don't know how quick Jong Hui's hands are.

00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:42.740
Customers swarmed in tonight.

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.680
We would've had it tough without her.

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:46.230
But Mom, why did you make her serve-

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:49.450
I begged her to let me do this.

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:53.700
I had to do something
to eat her dinner tonight. Right?

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:56.780
You didn't eat yet, right? You can eat with me.

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:00.990
What?

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:11.740
Bye.

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:14.370
And tell your driver-

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:15.670
Don't worry.

00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:18.700
I already told him you all once helped me.

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.550
He's tight-lipped.

00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:22.550
Thank goodness.

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:25.070
I should go. Go inside first. I'll see you off.

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:26.430
It's okay.

00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:27.820
Go on.

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:31.580
All right. I'll go. Have a safe drive.

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:35.270
Bye!

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:38.100
Goodbye.

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:55.300
Yeong Sik?

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:57.270
It's really you.

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:13.460
I called home, and Yeong Bae told me.

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:16.570
I wouldn't have believed it if
I hadn't seen you myself.

00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:18.440
I'm glad.

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:23.290
But you haven't changed much, Oppa.

00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:26.640
Maybe I'm wrong. You seem
to have gotten more handsome.

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:29.510
You've changed a lot.

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:32.430
I don't think I'd recognize you on the street.

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:34.100
Right?

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:35.880
I think so, too.

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:38.380
Sometimes, I look in the mirror and get startled,

00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:40.910
wondering if it's really me.

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:48.910
I wanted to meet you at least once.

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:53.050
You saved my life, after all.

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:55.370
Come on. That's not true.

00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:56.920
No, really.

00:47:57.810 --> 00:48:01.000
If it hadn't been for you that day,

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.430
I never would've dared come to Seoul.

00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:06.740
I have a long way to go.

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:08.650
When my mom had that accident,

00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:12.780
don't you remember we got back
on our feet, thanks to you?

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:16.590
When I make real money, I'll pay you back first.

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:18.330
It's fine.

00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:21.390
Pay me back with meals, then.
Maybe a hundred times?

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:29.300
These past few days have felt like a dream.

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:31.470
Yeong Rye, Mother,

00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:35.210
Yeong Bae, Yeong Mi, Jeong Bun, and Ho Suk.

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:37.230
And even you, Oppa.

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:41.110
I got to see everyone I wanted to see.

00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:52.210
What?

00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:55.470
Are you sure you got to see
everyone you wanted to see?

00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:57.340
Isn't there more?

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:07.040
You've always had a knack
for seeing right through people.

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:10.050
Do you know what I was always
envious of about Yeong Rye?

00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:12.600
That she has a brother like you.

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:20.180
I've taken up too much of your time.

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:22.520
I'll take up more of your time in the future.

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:24.510
Shall we go now?

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:40.150
I got a call from home earlier.

00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:42.400
Chairwoman is home.

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:44.900
- Mom?
- Yes.

00:49:57.410 --> 00:49:59.570
Thank you for everything.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.210
Mom.

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:11.560
You're home?

00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:13.580
How are you home already?

00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:15.470
I thought you were coming tomorrow.

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:17.690
That was the plan, but I was tired.

00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:20.490
So, I just rode with President Shin in his car.

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:22.060
You should've called.

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:24.950
The driver would've gone immediately.

00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:28.070
But what's with the car outside?

00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.050
Did you see it?

00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:31.760
Look at the situation today.

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:34.050
It would've been better if you had your own car.

00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:36.670
Don't refuse and use it. It's your gift.

00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:39.160
Mom, I'm really okay.

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:41.660
Just take it. The world is too dangerous.

00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:43.310
They say strike while the iron is hot.

00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:46.400
I just finished interviewing
a driver for your car.

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:49.270
Say hello. She'll be using the car.

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:54.260
Hello. My name is Kim Jeong Sik.

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:56.710
You can just call me Mr. Kim...

00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:04.200
- By any chance-
- How do you do?

00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:07.330
Ah, yes.

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:11.180
For a moment, I thought you were
someone I used to know

00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:13.340
because you look so much like her.

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.920
There's no way that's possible.

00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.190
Thank you in advance.

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:19.920
Oh, right. Remember tomorrow
at Operia Hotel, right?

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.300
With the second son of Seongwoo Group.

00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:25.550
It's just for a cup of tea, so no pressure.

00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:28.410
If it goes well, even better.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.500
I've polished it all nice and shiny.

00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:50.800
So it won't detract from your beauty. Please-

00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:31.790
You are. Right?

00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:35.650
Your name was Seo something.

Seo Jong Hui.

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.480
That's it! Seo Jong Hui.

00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:43.630
Ms. Seo, how... Wow, life is so funny.

00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:45.340
Your life is like a movie.

00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:48.680
Yesterday, I was a bit unsure.

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:52.030
But seeing you today, it's so clear.

00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:56.810
The shape of your eyes and that slender jawline.

00:52:56.810 --> 00:52:59.330
I was right.

00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:02.540
I've got a good eye, even for a man.

00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:04.510
I'm sure.

00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:06.630
To scout women to pick up.

00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:10.030
No need to be so blunt.

00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:11.860
How embarrassing.

00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:15.240
I've changed a lot.

00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:20.420
Forget the old, unbearably
frivolous Mr. Kim. Please.

00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:26.660
I'll forget. In return,

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:29.780
please forget my past, too.

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:31.260
Especially in front of my mom.

00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:34.520
Of course. I already caught on.

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:37.690
Don't worry. When I make up my mind,

00:53:37.690 --> 00:53:41.710
I can be an incredibly tight-lipped person.

00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:44.220
We're going to Operia Hotel, right?

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.630
Ahjumma, what brings you here?

00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:53.540
Gosh, you must be busy.

00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:57.390
I was going to head straight
to the hospital after work,

00:53:57.390 --> 00:54:01.450
but a regular customer who lives nearby called

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:04.470
and begged me to come, saying

00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:09.660
there's no other day that works except today.

00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:13.930
Could you take this to Jae Pil?

00:54:13.930 --> 00:54:17.820
It's clothes, underwear, and socks.

00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:20.170
I'm sure he's completely out and probably urgent.

00:54:20.170 --> 00:54:21.320
Okay, I will.

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:24.370
I'm not on the closing shift today,
so I can leave a bit early.

00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:29.000
Oh, really? That's even better.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:34.860
While you're there, ask Jae Pil to buy you
dinner at the hospital cafeteria.

00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:36.690
The food is all right there.

00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:38.470
They even serve Western food sometimes.

00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:41.410
No, it's fine. Jae Pil is busy.

00:54:41.410 --> 00:54:43.600
What do you mean busy...

00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:48.810
Yes, he's busy. He is busy, but still ask him.

00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:52.200
He'll buy you dinner. Of course, he will.

00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:55.870
It's not just anybody. It's you, Yeong Rye.

00:54:57.550 --> 00:54:58.860
I will, then.

00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:01.600
I'll happily let him treat me. Don't worry.

00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:05.660
Great. That's good. Good.

That color...

00:56:38.530 --> 00:56:40.710
They must be foreigners.

I guess you didn't like him.

The guy did seem a bit boring
even at first glance.

You know, like he was raised in a bubble?

She says it's your clothes, underwear, and socks.

00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:42.960
She said she'll be late

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:38.720
Hold on. Your eyelash.

01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:43.670
You're supposed to cut hair, not your eyelashes.

01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:46.000
You're so clumsy.

01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:49.140
So, why did you look?

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.470
I'll buy you dinner.

01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:03.280
Should I park the car or...

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:05.030
Let's just go.

01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:09.010
My business is done here.

01:01:16.650 --> 01:01:19.110
Beans are loaded with plant protein.

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:21.440
Good for bone density, prevents breast
cancer, and helps blood vessels.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:26.180
The world's best Cinderella crop,
and you won't eat them.

01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:30.630
Mom cooked bean rice so much
when I was little, and I'm sick of it.

01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:34.580
What about you? You can't handle
spicy food even as a grown-up.

01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:37.670
Such a kid, Han Jae Pil.

01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:42.940
Hey, I can handle spicy.

01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:45.730
I just don't like it.

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:50.550
- You want to see me eat it?
- Hey, forget it.

01:01:50.550 --> 01:01:52.890
Don't fill your stomach with water.

01:01:52.890 --> 01:01:55.490
Here. Have some anchovies instead.

01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:57.560
Here you go.

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:02.510
All right. Since I'm obedient to you.

01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:14.940
No matter how I think about it,
that's just not right.

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:18.080
I practically kicked him to the curb.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:23.030
Hey, Jae Pil.

01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:24.960
Yeah?

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:27.070
To tell you the truth,

01:02:28.070 --> 01:02:29.690
recently-

01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:32.810
Hey, Jae Pil! It's an emergency! Emergency...

01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:36.720
Chang Eui is freaking out again.

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:37.910
He's gathering everyone.

01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:40.620
- Geez!
- Hurry.

01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:42.230
I'm really sorry. I should go.

01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:43.410
It's fine. Go ahead.

01:02:43.410 --> 01:02:46.360
Finish everything before you go. Okay?

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:48.090
- Finish, okay?
- Yeah. Go!

01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:50.040
I'll buy you something good again. Sorry.

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:51.740
I'm sorry!

01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:31.350
Thank you.

01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:34.350
I'll see you tomorrow. Good night.

01:04:47.590 --> 01:04:50.390
Wow, looking good around here.

01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:53.880
They say send horses to Jeju and people to Seoul.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:57.740
As expected of Seoul. Especially Gangnam.

01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:03.890
Isn't that Choi Jeong Bun?

01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:09.790
Bun!

01:05:09.790 --> 01:05:12.070
It really is you, Choi Jeong Bun.

01:05:12.070 --> 01:05:15.750
I wasn't sure if it was you.

01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:18.480
But it is. Gosh.

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:19.900
Whoa!

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:22.810
I was just passing by and

01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:25.500
saw a woman, who looks like you, walking down.

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:28.830
Wow. How have you been?

01:05:28.830 --> 01:05:30.760
You've gotten prettier.

01:05:32.410 --> 01:05:36.430
We're not on good enough terms
to greet each other so happily.

01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:39.080
Huh? Hey, come on.

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:40.710
You can't just leave like this.

01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:43.440
We have a past.

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:46.950
How about we grab a cup of tea?

01:05:52.650 --> 01:05:55.930
If I have time to sit and chat with you over tea,

01:05:55.930 --> 01:05:59.570
I'd rather go home, wash my feet,
and get some sleep.

01:05:59.570 --> 01:06:02.690
Don't you think so? I'm not interested.

01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:12.290
She's so cold. The Siberian cold front
has nothing on her.

01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:16.540
She's even more attractive now.

01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:19.950
All right.

01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:54.470
I'm home.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.760
What is it?

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:22.230
Who are you, ahjussi?

01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:23.680
Well, who are you?

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.430
I'm Su Jin. Choi Su Jin.

01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:26.650
I see. Su Jin.

01:07:26.650 --> 01:07:29.110
You shouldn't wander around the market alone.

01:07:29.110 --> 01:07:30.420
Where are your mom and dad?

01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:32.630
My mom went to work over there.

01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:34.840
And my dad isn't here.

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:40.260
Your dad isn't here?

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:42.560
Why? Did he go somewhere?

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:44.220
No, he's just not here.

01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:47.420
My dad was never here from the beginning.

01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:48.600
Oh, gosh!

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.670
- Su Jin!
- Mom!

01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:57.500
I said I'm done with you.

01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:01.100
Why did you follow me all the way
here and bother my kid?

01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:04.000
I didn't bother her. She just asked me who I was.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.610
Forget it!

01:08:06.450 --> 01:08:09.960
Go. Just get out of here!

01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:12.440
What's wrong with you?

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:14.620
I'm here to eat. Why are you getting mad?

01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:18.320
I'm not selling food to you. Just go.

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:20.740
Can't you hear me? Huh?

01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:23.980
You make me shudder when I see you.

01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:26.970
Just go, will you?

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:29.900
All right. I'm going. I'll go.

01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:32.070
Such an attitude.

01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:39.530
I'm sorry for yelling.

01:08:47.010 --> 01:08:48.910
[Jullee Beauty Salon]

01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:51.190
Yeong Rye!

01:08:51.190 --> 01:08:52.850
There's a flower basket at the door.

01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:55.130
Looks like it's addressed to you.

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:59.710
[To: Ko Yeong Rye]
Who would send me this...

01:08:59.710 --> 01:09:01.150
Who is it from?

01:09:01.150 --> 01:09:03.380
Hey. Could it be from Jae Pil?

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:06.930
Who else would send something like this to you?

01:09:06.930 --> 01:09:08.950
It's him. It's Han Jae Pil.

01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:13.440
How many blossoms are there? So many!

01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:16.930
Jae Pil wouldn't send something like this.

01:09:16.930 --> 01:09:19.790
You're right. I sent them.

01:09:22.190 --> 01:09:24.280
Not Jae Pil.

01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:26.200
Oppa!

01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:35.730
Why are there so many customers
asking for her lately?

01:09:35.730 --> 01:09:37.500
She'll become a manager in no time.

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.470
That's what I'm saying.

01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:42.930
Is there some secret sales trick or something?

01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:44.790
Let's go.

01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:54.750
You have to tell me the style
you want before I cut.

01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:56.950
I won't complain even if it
looks like a rat chewed on it.

01:09:56.950 --> 01:10:00.080
So, do whatever style you want, Ms. Ko Yeong Rye.

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:03.130
I'll gladly be your personal model.

01:10:03.130 --> 01:10:04.920
Try something bold and groundbreaking.

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:08.240
What will you do if I just shave it all off?

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:10.560
It won't matter since I'm handsome.

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:13.690
I don't rely on my hair for good looks.

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:18.610
I can't argue with that.

01:10:18.610 --> 01:10:23.740
Honestly, your head shape is really nice.

01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:25.490
It is.

01:10:27.770 --> 01:10:30.880
By the way, Yeong Rye, you've changed a lot.

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:34.160
I have? How so?

01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:37.470
Remember when we talked about the
right to pursue happiness?

01:10:39.330 --> 01:10:44.390
I feel like you're finally enjoying that.

01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:48.580
You laugh more and speak your mind more clearly.

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:54.020
I'm a little sad, though. You no longer
need me as your Daddy-Long-Legs.

01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:55.760
Not yet.

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.880
I'll still give out the occasional SOS,

01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:00.600
so keep being my Daddy-Long-Legs.

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.570
Oh, no!

01:11:04.570 --> 01:11:05.980
I cut too much.

01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:10.200
Hey, did you give me a bald patch? Hey...

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.280
I'm just kidding.

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:15.200
You said you wouldn't complain. What was that?

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.670
I was just playing along, too.

01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:23.350
So, what time do you finish today,
Ms. Ko Yeong Rye?

01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:27.520
I'm not on the closing shift,
so in a couple more hours.

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:30.760
Really? Should I wait and buy you dinner?

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:32.830
Something expensive and fancy?

01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:35.960
I'd love that, but I have
a prior engagement today.

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.830
Oh, yeah?

01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:39.700
What prior engagement?

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:17.930
You want to die?

01:12:17.930 --> 01:12:19.460
I said I didn't see it.

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:21.040
It hurts.

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:22.980
Hold on. Your eyelash.

01:12:58.170 --> 01:12:59.520
This way.

01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:06.530
We transported her from a stable
after she lost consciousness from a fall.

01:13:06.530 --> 01:13:08.510
Her vitals are relatively stable,

01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:11.590
but there may have been an impact to the head.

01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:13.290
I got that. Thanks for your work.

01:13:13.290 --> 01:13:14.900
Thank you, Doctor.

01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:17.500
- Get an IV line started.
- Yes, Doctor.

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:39.670
You shouldn't get up.

01:13:39.670 --> 01:13:42.350
Ma'am, it's all right! This is the hospital.
Please calm down.

01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:45.120
- Ma'am!
- Ma'am, please calm down.

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:27.510
Didn't you hear the nurse? You can't leave yet.

01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:30.670
I'm fine. I'm not injured.

01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:38.180
I'm the doctor.

01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:40.460
Get examined before you go.

01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:43.160
Then and now, you haven't changed.

01:14:44.290 --> 01:14:47.120
You still have a knack for shocking people.

01:15:00.710 --> 01:15:02.470
Thanks so much, Oppa.

01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:04.750
Thanks to you, I could-

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.850
Who do you mean by "The calm before the storm"?

01:16:07.850 --> 01:16:10.410
Yeong Rye. Jae Pil. Jong Hui.

01:16:10.410 --> 01:16:12.330
Who knows? And maybe also...

01:16:12.330 --> 01:16:13.710
I'm her boyfriend. Now what?

01:16:13.710 --> 01:16:16.470
You seem awfully close to Yeong Rye.

01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:18.300
She's a friend I can't live without now.

01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:20.350
Just a close friend?

01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:22.460
Out of people who brushed past my life,

01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:24.440
I used to think those who left are mere ties

01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:28.100
and the ones who stayed are destiny.

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:30.630
As for the one who returns,

01:16:30.630 --> 01:16:34.180
is she a mere connection or destiny?

01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:35.900
Or...
