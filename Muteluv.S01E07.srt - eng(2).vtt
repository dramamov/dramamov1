Support Admin Watch on

00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.976
Didn’t you say our job
is to reveal the truth to the public?

00:00:04.016 --> 00:00:08.856
My job right now
is to protect the Chatharusati Family.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.632
You asked me to let Phupar
take credit for this case.

00:00:18.656 --> 00:00:20.180
Are you sure about it?

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.888
Yes, I’m sure.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.048
Lieutenant, why didn’t you tell her?

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.728
THE CHANTHARUSATI CULT
IS SHUT DOWN PERMANENTLY!

00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:36.896
A FORMER IDOL SINGER REVEALS
HOW HE WAS BRAINWASHED BY FATHER.

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:40.176
At the time, I couldn’t stand it.

00:00:40.208 --> 00:00:41.360
A FORMER IDOL STAR INSISTS
HE HAS NO INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CULT.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.552
I couldn’t watch
the Chatharusati cult exploiting people,

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.720
who are lack of a support system.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.184
I decided to go undercover in the cult
to find the truth.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.736
But I…

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.400
I fell for their scam.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.080
If this person didn’t help me,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.672
I wouldn’t be here today.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.872
Are you talking about the police?

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:31.688
Yes.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.888
The real hero is the police.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.048
This is terrible.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.064
The Chantharusati family will never go away.

00:01:45.096 --> 00:01:47.880
They will stay with us
like the moon and the earth.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.480
The Chantharusati family will never go away.

00:01:51.512 --> 00:01:54.552
They will stay with us
like the moon and the earth.

00:01:54.584 --> 00:01:57.448
The Chantharusati family will never go away.

00:01:57.488 --> 00:02:00.000
They will stay with us
like the moon and the earth.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.520
They will stay with us
like the moon and the earth.

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:04.890
Mother of Chantharusati.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.320
Mother of Chantharusati.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.320
Mother of Chantharusati.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.320
Mother of Chantharusati.

00:02:11.352 --> 00:02:13.128
Mother of Chantharusati.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.776
Mother of Chantharusati.

00:02:14.816 --> 00:02:16.224
What are you doing here?

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.464
Get out.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.632
Who is Mother of Chantharusati?

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.008
It’s nothing.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.288
Is she Father’s wife?

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.768
That’s enough.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.888
Ploy is also a victim.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.888
Just like me, and those people outside.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.696
She has suffered from this enough.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.800
If you don’t stop asking about this,

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.880
I will have to end this interview.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.896
Okay.

00:02:51.928 --> 00:02:55.464
Let’s talk about that night.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.736
Can you tell us what happened?

00:03:32.384 --> 00:03:34.380
Thank you, Phu.

00:03:34.912 --> 00:03:36.910
For covering it up for me.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.544
You even raised your voice with the reporter
to stop it.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.808
It’s my job

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.440
to protect the real hero who saved me.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.000
Phu.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.616
Phu.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.448
How are you doing?

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.216
I’m okay.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.200
Why?

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.704
I barely saw you on campus.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.136
I heard that you’ve been missing classes
for a few weeks.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.544
I was busy with interviews.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.392
I became a highly sought-after person.

00:04:32.416 --> 00:04:34.168
Thanks to you.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.320
I’ll start to attend the classes again soon.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.944
I don’t want to stay in school for another year.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.320
Excuse me, I have class.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.344
Yes.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.896
You have been reborn.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.880
But you chose to go back to being the old you.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.288
I’ll start to attend the classes again soon.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.880
I don’t want to stay in school for another year.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.192
But you don’t want to attend classes, do you?

00:05:47.728 --> 00:05:49.880
You are putting on a facade again

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.064
so people will love you.

00:05:52.088 --> 00:05:53.064
Stop it.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.184
Ouch!

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.000
Phu, what the hell is wrong with you?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.448
Phu, what the hell is wrong with you?

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.176
Why did you hit me?

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.352
Will my eye go blind?

00:06:05.384 --> 00:06:09.224
(The Chantharusati family will never go away.)

00:06:09.248 --> 00:06:13.264
(They will stay with us
like the moon and the earth.)

00:06:14.088 --> 00:06:16.090
(They will stay with us
like the moon and the earth.)

00:06:16.128 --> 00:06:20.888
(I thought it was over.)

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.888
(Instead, this is the beginning of a new chapter)

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.864
(that is more chaotic.)

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:40.664
Today, we’re going to talk
about news coverage in the digital era.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.936
In the past, when I was young.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.512
People watched the news from official outlets

00:07:49.528 --> 00:07:50.248
Ploy.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:51.720
Hey.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.864
such as the radio or television stations.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.048
Jued.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:56.480
Jued.

00:08:06.648 --> 00:08:08.024
What’s wrong?

00:08:08.048 --> 00:08:09.624
I saw a cockroach.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.048
But it’s okay. I chased it away.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.976
Let’s get back to our lesson.

00:08:18.016 --> 00:08:19.640
What are you doing?

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.488
What’s wrong with you?

00:08:21.648 --> 00:08:24.104
You’ve been looking down for a few days.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.464
Is it because of Phu?

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.480
I get it. He’s been acting strange lately.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.376
But normally, he’s weird.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.144
It’s just a different type of strange.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.240
But this time is different.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.104
I can feel that something is off.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.576
It’s like…

00:08:51.608 --> 00:08:54.344
What I’m trying to say is that
it’s okay if you are stressed about it.

00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:56.340
But right now,
you need to pay attention in class.

00:08:56.368 --> 00:08:58.340
So you can help me study for the exam.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:05.328
You came to the class
when it will be over in 15 minutes?

00:09:10.816 --> 00:09:12.820
I just transferred to this college.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.016
This is my enrollment document.

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:24.328
Don’t be late next time.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:26.728
Yes.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.248
Something is fishy.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:00.000
Something is fishy.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.664
Something is fishy.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.312
What is fishy?

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.336
You and the new student.

00:10:06.376 --> 00:10:07.264
Do you know him?

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:09.896
No.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.008
Liar.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:13.928
See?

00:10:14.472 --> 00:10:15.552
You’re acting sketchy.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.080
You always tell me everything.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.680
But you didn’t tell me about him.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.928
Did you and he…

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:29.960
Fried meatball cart?!

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.200
The line is long.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.296
It must be delicious.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.976
If you buy me fried meatballs,

00:10:37.016 --> 00:10:38.032
I’ll stop suspecting you.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.320
Your curiosity can be gone so easily.

00:10:40.352 --> 00:10:41.296
Are you going to buy them or not?

00:10:41.328 --> 00:10:42.560
Fine, I’ll buy them.

00:11:00.432 --> 00:11:01.912
Fay, go wait in the room.

00:11:01.928 --> 00:11:02.624
I’ll buy meatballs from another shop.

00:11:02.648 --> 00:11:03.664
No, I want to eat meatballs.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.936
I’ll buy from another shop.

00:11:04.968 --> 00:11:06.392
No, I’m not going.

00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:08.896
I want to eat meatballs.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.992
I’m saying this because you’re my friend.

00:11:13.024 --> 00:11:15.568
You should eat food
that is good for your health.

00:11:15.608 --> 00:11:16.496
Do you hear me?

00:11:16.544 --> 00:11:19.112
Yes, but I want to eat meatballs.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.112
I can take care of my health later.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.872
I’ll take it.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.896
It’s a small gift from a new member of this dorm.

00:11:41.944 --> 00:11:45.152
From today, I’m your next-door neighbor.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:46.728
Huh?

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.648
Next-door neighbor?

00:11:48.688 --> 00:11:50.096
But this is an all-female dorm?

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.080
So you didn’t know?

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.712
The dorm’s owner has changed the rule.

00:11:55.744 --> 00:11:56.712
ALL-FEMALE DORM

00:11:56.728 --> 00:11:58.710
CO-ED DORM.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.440
You two knew each other, right?

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.912
Actually…

00:12:14.936 --> 00:12:16.640
Actually, we are…

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:18.240
- A distant relative.
- A neighbor.

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:24.696
He is my distant relative
who lived in the same neighborhood.

00:12:24.728 --> 00:12:27.288
Yes.

00:12:27.328 --> 00:12:29.704
We are distant relatives.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:32.120
That’s all?

00:12:32.152 --> 00:12:34.832
I thought you were secretly dating him.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.920
Can you come into the room?

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.056
I don’t want to keep standing at the door.

00:12:40.088 --> 00:12:40.960
No.

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.704
How can I let a guy come into our room?

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.488
You should go back to your room.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.104
What?

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.720
You transferred to our college
in the middle of the semester.

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:11.888
Do you need any help with your study?

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.312
Aren’t you going to study with us?

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.184
If I study now, I will forget it
when it’s time for the exam.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.760
I’ll let you and your relative
reminisce about your past.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:31.848
I’ll leave.

00:13:37.136 --> 00:13:38.456
Aren’t you going to eat it?

00:13:38.488 --> 00:13:39.360
It’s delicious.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.368
I’ll get to the point.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.232
You’ve been following me at school
and also here.

00:13:47.248 --> 00:13:48.640
Because it’s not over yet, right?

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:51.664
What are you talking about?

00:13:51.688 --> 00:13:53.864
I came here to attend school.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.984
Have you ever heard
that you’re never too old to learn?

00:13:59.008 --> 00:14:00.000
FATHER IS SPOTTED.
HE WILL BE BACK.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.280
FATHER IS SPOTTED.
HE WILL BE BACK.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.528
I saw on the internet
that Father escaped from the police raid.

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:08.560
Stop dodging the truth.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.680
The netizens are annoying.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.128
So it’s true?

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:20.248
Yes.

00:14:20.976 --> 00:14:24.600
That’s why I have to monitor people
who are involved in the case like you.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.352
Why do you need to do that?

00:14:27.392 --> 00:14:29.496
Am I in danger?

00:14:36.864 --> 00:14:38.860
The police believe that…

00:14:38.896 --> 00:14:40.860
if Father wants to take revenge

00:14:40.904 --> 00:14:43.056
on those who destroyed his cult.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.672
The person who is likely to be his target is you.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:22.376
Father is a dangerous man.

00:15:22.424 --> 00:15:24.890
But he’s not a professional killer.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.464
Carelessness leads to disaster.

00:15:29.496 --> 00:15:30.832
Have you heard it?

00:15:30.872 --> 00:15:32.168
Yes.

00:15:32.192 --> 00:15:33.712
I can take care of myself.

00:15:37.184 --> 00:15:38.616
Stop it.

00:15:38.664 --> 00:15:41.416
If someone sees you acting like this,
they will be suspicious.

00:15:41.464 --> 00:15:45.304
His followers might be hiding
among the people around us.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:47.400
We should be cautious.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.008
No.

00:16:02.048 --> 00:16:03.536
This is embarrassing.

00:16:03.576 --> 00:16:04.720
I’ll take a taxi.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.952
Are you worried about your image
rather than your safety?

00:16:07.992 --> 00:16:10.224
Why is taking a taxi not safe?

00:16:10.272 --> 00:16:13.696
What do you do if the driver is his follower?

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.320
Public transportation is dangerous.

00:16:16.344 --> 00:16:19.776
A police car is the safest way to commute.

00:16:19.824 --> 00:16:20.728
It is another level…

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:24.344
Hey.

00:16:24.384 --> 00:16:25.536
Get off the bike.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.472
It’s the government’s asset.

00:16:27.504 --> 00:16:28.384
Get off.

00:16:28.768 --> 00:16:30.770
A taxi is not safe. The bike is not good.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.032
Are you coming or not?

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.496
Are you ready?

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.568
You feel embarrassed
about riding in the police car.

00:16:39.592 --> 00:16:40.880
But don’t feel embarrassed
to ride a meatball cart?

00:16:42.584 --> 00:16:44.944
Can you ride properly?

00:16:44.976 --> 00:16:46.008
Why are you riding so slowly?

00:16:46.864 --> 00:16:48.464
If you don’t like how I ride it,
just get off the bike.

00:16:48.496 --> 00:16:49.904
Then let me ride it.

00:16:49.944 --> 00:16:51.304
No, I’m riding it.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:53.488
Stop the bike. So I can get off.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.592
No, I don’t know how to stop it.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.776
Thanks.

00:17:02.808 --> 00:17:03.904
Get well soon.

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.592
I’ve got to go. Bye.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:11.216
Ake.

00:17:12.456 --> 00:17:13.264
Ake.

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:15.032
What happened?

00:17:16.112 --> 00:17:17.616
It was nothing.

00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:20.928
We’re temporarily halting our club’s activities.

00:17:21.992 --> 00:17:24.224
Why?

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:27.904
Did Phu tell you to do it?

00:17:27.944 --> 00:17:29.900
It’s my order.

00:17:29.928 --> 00:17:31.900
So Phu can take a break.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:35.160
He’s not doing well lately.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:39.232
He hasn’t told anyone about it.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:41.496
He probably doesn’t want you guys
to worry about him.

00:17:43.904 --> 00:17:45.200
I think…

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.464
he has a mental episode.

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.848
I’m not a doctor.

00:17:51.888 --> 00:17:54.280
But I think his condition is pretty serious.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:55.424
I think…

00:17:55.432 --> 00:17:56.408
Where is Phu?

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.000
I think he’s in a class in Building 3.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.616
I think he’s in a class in Building 3.

00:18:00.656 --> 00:18:01.512
Thank you.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:06.688
My foot.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.312
Shit.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:34.800
Shit.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.568
Student, are you alright?

00:18:40.608 --> 00:18:41.264
Shit.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.440
You can’t run away from your fate.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:54.944
Phu.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.608
Phu.

00:18:57.696 --> 00:18:58.624
Phu.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.000
Phu.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.216
Phu.

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:01.904
Phu.

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:04.080
Phu.

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:27.816
Phu.

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:31.096
Ploy.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.152
Don’t cry,

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:36.824
I’m not dead yet.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.224
Phu, what happened?

00:19:59.056 --> 00:20:00.000
Why didn’t you tell anyone?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.060
Why didn’t you tell anyone?

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.720
Why did you suddenly…

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:21.064
I had hallucinations.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.840
I saw Father.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:31.200
I’m sorry.

00:20:31.896 --> 00:20:33.900
I didn’t tell you about it.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:39.864
I don’t know what’s going on with me.

00:20:45.688 --> 00:20:47.690
I was afraid that if I told you,

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.600
you would look at me differently.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:12.952
Ploy, I’m sorry.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:16.888
I’m scared.

00:21:34.952 --> 00:21:36.950
I thought I could catch him.

00:21:36.984 --> 00:21:38.950
But he was just a hallucination.

00:21:38.984 --> 00:21:40.656
I can’t do anything about it.

00:21:40.704 --> 00:21:43.880
I didn’t know he could astral travel.

00:21:44.168 --> 00:21:46.170
He must have learned it from a sorcerer.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:00.000
I’m sorry.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:00.368
I’m sorry.

00:22:02.408 --> 00:22:04.128
I just don’t want you to be stressed.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.728
I don’t want you to get sick, too.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.568
Phu is having a hard time,

00:22:11.608 --> 00:22:13.792
but I can’t do anything to help him.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.064
Actually, there’s a way to help him.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.672
How did I forget it?

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:30.800
Get up.

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:32.720
Go where?

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.368
I have a class in the afternoon.

00:22:34.416 --> 00:22:35.584
Follow me.

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:46.992
Don’t overthink it.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:51.720
Phupar will be discharged from the hospital
before you finish the shopping.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:53.696
Of course, I have to think a lot.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.440
It’s not for me.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.008
We’re buying a gift for a patient.

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.600
Even though it’s a gift for him.

00:23:08.648 --> 00:23:10.600
You can buy something that you like.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.864
So when he sees it,

00:23:12.888 --> 00:23:14.176
it will remind him of you.

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:30.424
What if I’m a boring person?

00:23:31.576 --> 00:23:32.784
There’s nothing special about me.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.312
I don’t even have a dream.

00:23:38.904 --> 00:23:40.464
My life is empty like this notebook.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.816
Does he still want to have it?

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.128
Why is this notebook boring?

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.536
We can write anything on it.

00:23:50.576 --> 00:23:52.720
It has unlimited possibilities.

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:57.672
If Phupar vents his feelings in this notebook,

00:23:58.168 --> 00:24:00.000
It might help him feel better.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:00.170
It might help him feel better.

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:03.608
That’s true.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:13.512
Do you really not have any dreams?

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:22.680
If I can choose,

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:27.736
I want to be a writer
who has best-selling books.

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:29.784
I guess.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.440
It’s not too late.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.552
Why don’t you buy two notebooks?

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.664
One is for Phupar.

00:24:36.688 --> 00:24:38.660
The other is for you.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:46.992
Okay.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.424
I’ll buy the notebook.

00:24:48.448 --> 00:24:49.648
Great.

00:24:49.688 --> 00:24:51.120
I’ll pay for it.

00:24:51.144 --> 00:24:52.624
It’s okay. I can afford it.

00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:58.496
I said it’s okay.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.232
No.

00:24:59.248 --> 00:25:00.000
You’re obstructing a police officer.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.776
You’re obstructing a police officer.

00:25:01.808 --> 00:25:03.400
You should let the one with an income
pay for it.

00:25:03.416 --> 00:25:04.304
No, I’ll pay for it. Give it to me.

00:25:04.328 --> 00:25:04.616
No.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.352
Give it to me. I’ll pay for it.

00:25:06.384 --> 00:25:07.680
Give it to me.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.624
A distant relative
who lived in the same neighborhood?

00:25:13.672 --> 00:25:15.880
It looks like this is a scene
from a rom-com movie.

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.896
RELATIVES?
#ROM-COMFILM

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:44.352
Didn’t she say she has an afternoon class?

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.000
You are neither her relative nor her neighbor.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.264
You are neither her relative nor her neighbor.

00:26:02.296 --> 00:26:03.504
You are a cop!

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.640
Do you want everyone to hear it?

00:26:05.672 --> 00:26:07.056
I’m shocked.

00:26:07.088 --> 00:26:09.060
Then why did you lie to me?

00:26:10.456 --> 00:26:11.624
The more people know about it,

00:26:11.664 --> 00:26:13.620
the harder it is for the police to do their job.

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:17.200
Since you’re neither her relative nor neighbor,

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.640
the rom-com scene I saw earlier…

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.130
Use your critical thinking skills.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.520
He’s here to protect me.

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:29.880
Please take care of my beautiful friend, Officer.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:31.008
Huh?

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:35.688
I don’t want to be a third wheel in his operation.

00:26:35.728 --> 00:26:37.456
I’d better go. Bye.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:44.104
What’s wrong with her?

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:46.144
Here.

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.184
Let’s go back to the hospital.

00:26:52.208 --> 00:26:53.016
Hold on.

00:26:53.888 --> 00:26:55.048
Why?

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.920
Phupar is hospitalized.

00:26:57.952 --> 00:26:59.256
He won’t go anywhere.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:00.000
Come on.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:00.720
Come on.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.880
Follow me.

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:06.896
Otherwise, I’ll charge you
for obstruction of justice.

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:16.776
Didn’t you say you can take care of yourself?

00:27:16.816 --> 00:27:18.904
Show me.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.944
Try again.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.424
Your score must be as high as mine.

00:27:32.472 --> 00:27:35.224
I’m just a tiny girl.

00:27:35.256 --> 00:27:36.320
How can I compete with you?

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:38.624
This kind of stuff is up to our mentality.

00:27:38.672 --> 00:27:41.424
My ancestors said that
mentality is the most important…

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:46.568
Are you happy now?

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:49.352
No.

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:50.448
Come with me.

00:27:50.984 --> 00:27:52.980
Let’s compete on this.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:00.000
Do you really know how to play?

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.576
Do you really know how to play?

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.512
It’s not that hard.

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:12.888
Will we get one today?

00:28:13.896 --> 00:28:14.752
Move.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:18.288
See? My spell works.

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.168
Why did I barely get it?

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:12.192
You’re working

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:20.928
to distract yourself from
thinking about Ploy being with another man.

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:34.192
She probably forgot about you.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.712
It’s so obvious.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:06.560
Posing yourself as an activist is outdated.

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.376
No one finds this version of you interesting.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:13.384
This is why…

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:18.032
Ploy is with another man.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.888
Shut up!

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:26.224
It’s not too late, Comrade Phupar.

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:29.896
Humans are weak.

00:30:31.192 --> 00:30:35.176
Spiritual support is indispensable for our world.

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:38.704
Let’s start over again.

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.432
Leave me alone.

00:30:42.456 --> 00:30:43.648
Ouch!

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:45.440
That hurts.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.704
I bought a gift for Phu.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.880
But we missed him because of you.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:13.500
It’s a good thing
Phupar was discharged from the hospital.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.128
It means he’s doing fine.

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:17.864
That’s true.

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:22.312
Wait, wait.

00:31:22.352 --> 00:31:23.512
No.

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:25.576
You lost.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.656
Then you should buy me a meal.

00:31:26.712 --> 00:31:27.688
I’ll buy you a meal.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.176
But you can’t eat these.

00:31:29.192 --> 00:31:30.584
They’ve been in the cart since yesterday.

00:31:30.608 --> 00:31:33.792
If you’re going to bail on me, just say it.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:35.896
I’m not going to bail on you.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.136
How about this?

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.680
Tell me what you want to eat.

00:31:43.712 --> 00:31:45.392
I’ll buy it for you tomorrow morning.

00:31:45.408 --> 00:31:46.264
Okay.

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:48.024
Don’t bail on me.

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:54.192
Bye.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:11.888
I have nothing to give you.

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.872
I have only leftover meatballs from yesterday.

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:16.032
Do you really want them?

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:12.400
I haven’t used the martial art moves
I learned from my friend.

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:15.088
But I have a new spell I want to try.

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:18.672
I’ll try it on you.

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:24.824
Oh.

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.008
They are gone.

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:41.888
FATHER WILL BE BACK.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:55.920
Comrade Phupar.

00:33:56.610 --> 00:34:00.000
You and I can work together
to rebuild our Chantharusati Family.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.760
You and I can work together
to rebuild our Chantharusati Family.

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:05.824
The police are searching for me.

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:09.640
But you, Comrade Phupar.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.296
You can take my place and be the new Father.

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:14.608
Are you crazy?

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:16.264
No way.

00:34:23.768 --> 00:34:28.176
In this book are guidelines
on how to build and grow a cult.

00:34:28.208 --> 00:34:32.592
It also has information
to blackmail power brokers.

00:34:32.616 --> 00:34:36.064
They will help us raise money
to rebuild our family.

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:43.336
All you need to do is follow the guidelines
in this book and bring Ploy back.

00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:45.944
Then everything will be perfect.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:51.064
Ploy?

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:53.072
Why do we need her?

00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:57.584
You may not see it right now.

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:00.000
To make our family complete,

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.192
To make our family complete,

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:05.616
we need a symbol for people to hold on to.

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.032
That is Ploy.

00:35:09.544 --> 00:35:11.540
She’s my Sangchan.

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:13.064
Sangchan?

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:14.952
Who is she?

00:35:24.656 --> 00:35:30.120
Sangchan was my first and only love.

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:33.592
(Back then, I didn’t have any friends.)

00:35:33.608 --> 00:35:35.360
(I was always bullied.)

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:38.504
(Sangchan was the only one…)

00:36:12.912 --> 00:36:14.088
Hello, Boss.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:14.920
Anything for me, sir?

00:36:14.976 --> 00:36:17.616
Wutkrai, no one has told you, right?

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:18.784
You can come back to the station.

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:19.776
Go back?

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:22.048
Why?

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:24.936
We arrested Father last night.

00:36:28.136 --> 00:36:29.432
It was Phupar.

00:36:30.264 --> 00:36:32.260
He called to inform us.

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:52.384
The members of Chantharusati
have applied for bail for Father.

00:36:52.408 --> 00:36:57.088
But the bail is denied
until the investigation is over.

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:00.000
What about Ploy?

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.344
What about Ploy?

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:05.024
Say goodbye to her
and hurry back to the station.

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.816
You need to be back
before the press conference begins.

00:38:02.728 --> 00:38:04.440
You didn’t tell me that you were coming.

00:38:04.488 --> 00:38:06.440
Now, are you leaving without saying goodbye?

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.672
This is how my job is.

00:38:12.696 --> 00:38:14.670
The fewer people know, the better it is.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.424
If you are tired of being a cop,

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.864
you should open a fried meatball shop.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:21.864
I think you will do well.

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:27.136
I’ll think about it.

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:36.616
Thank you for the sausages

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:39.864
and for taking care of me.

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:50.304
It’s my job as a police officer.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:57.224
So I won’t be seeing you again.

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:08.376
That’s a good thing.

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:11.312
It means…

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:13.872
you are not in danger.

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:28.936
Wait, what are you doing?

00:39:38.784 --> 00:39:40.940
This is Pra Jiad armband.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.376
It’s a protective talisman.

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:52.080
This armband has been passed down
from my ancestors.

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:53.432
Wait.

00:39:53.448 --> 00:39:55.560
It’s important to you.

00:39:55.608 --> 00:39:56.624
You should keep it.

00:39:56.648 --> 00:39:57.784
I can’t have it.

00:39:57.808 --> 00:39:58.904
Keep it.

00:39:58.928 --> 00:40:00.000
I have dozens of them at home.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:00.592
I have dozens of them at home.

00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:03.240
Just think of it as…

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:06.080
my parting gift.

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:47.408
(After that day,)

00:40:48.656 --> 00:40:50.660
(things return to normal.)

00:40:53.136 --> 00:40:58.464
Walter Lippmann said,
The function of news…

00:40:58.976 --> 00:41:00.000
(Though things go back to normal)

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:00.980
(Though things go back to normal)

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:05.328
(I can’t help but feel a bit lonely.)

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:07.880
(I can’t explain why.)

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.488
CLEAR THE CLUB’S ROOM.

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:16.584
I’ve spent four years here.

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:18.328
When it’s time for me to leave,

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:19.784
I kind of feel lonely.

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:28.176
After this, the future of our club.

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:30.688
I’ll leave it in your hands.

00:41:30.728 --> 00:41:34.400
Ake, Phu is not coming today?

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:38.440
Yeah, today is his last day at the club.

00:41:38.496 --> 00:41:42.224
He’s probably busy finding a job.

00:41:42.264 --> 00:41:43.072
Ploy.

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:44.968
Have you seen Phu recently?

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:50.696
Fay.

00:41:50.736 --> 00:41:51.744
What’s wrong?

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:53.424
It’s cute, isn’t it?

00:41:54.136 --> 00:41:56.080
I’m usually not interested in this kind of stuff.

00:41:56.136 --> 00:41:58.096
But this is up my alley.

00:41:58.112 --> 00:42:00.000
It looks derpy.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:00.864
It looks derpy.

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:02.600
It’s just another art toy.

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.488
It’s not an art toy.

00:42:04.512 --> 00:42:05.944
It’s a talisman.

00:42:05.968 --> 00:42:07.336
It’s a big hit right now.

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:09.888
You have it too?

00:42:09.928 --> 00:42:10.224
Yes.

00:42:10.248 --> 00:42:11.776
Let’s take a selfie together.

00:42:11.816 --> 00:42:12.656
Good.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:14.660
Great.

00:42:14.944 --> 00:42:16.024
Awesome.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.120
What?

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:52.472
You haven’t moved on from it.

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:54.616
The case was closed for a few months.

00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:59.864
Something about it is still bothering me.

00:43:03.416 --> 00:43:05.420
It’s probably nothing.

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:14.512
PLOY IN MY HEART

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:24.000
Hello.

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:25.912
It’s been a while since our last talk.

00:43:25.928 --> 00:43:28.328
(Officer, I have something to tell you.)

00:43:29.512 --> 00:43:31.510
Hey, are you okay?

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:32.744
Your voice sounds tense.

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.288
(Hey, who are you?)

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:36.280
(What are you doing?)

00:43:36.312 --> 00:43:36.590
Ploy.

00:43:36.592 --> 00:43:37.140
(Hey.)

00:43:37.152 --> 00:43:38.032
Ploy.

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:39.512
Ploy.

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:36.792
Mother.

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:41.168
Mother of Chantharusati has woken up.

00:44:41.456 --> 00:44:43.170
Mother.

00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:45.056
Mother.

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:47.352
Father.

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:49.320
Father.

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:51.408
Father.

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:53.616
Father.

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:56.072
Father.

00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:57.880
Father.

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:00.000
Father.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:00.336
Father.

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.344
Father.

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:04.336
Father.

00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:06.552
Father.

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:20.832
The moon is shining again

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:26.248
as the new Father has arrived.

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:29.536
Phu.

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:32.120
What are you doing?

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:37.240
All that time, I was wrong.

00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:41.872
I thought cults corrupted society.

00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:45.536
They profit from people’s faith.

00:45:46.264 --> 00:45:48.260
But now I get it.

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:52.752
We can build a cult that is pristine

00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:56.808
and pure.

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.000
This is why I’m building a new cult.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.944
This is why I’m building a new cult.

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:06.320
The only person who can help me build it,

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:09.360
it’s you, Ploy.

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:20.112
Ploy, you are important to me.

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:23.312
If you come to be with me,

00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:30.320
we can build a perfect cult
that will be useful for our society.

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:35.328
Ploy, will you join me?

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:37.720
Right here.

00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:39.688
Right now.

00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:43.104
And forever.

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:49.848
Father.

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:51.592
Mother.

00:46:51.704 --> 00:46:55.640
Wishing you the blessing of children.

00:46:55.672 --> 00:46:57.440
Father.

00:46:57.464 --> 00:46:58.992
Mother.

00:46:59.016 --> 00:47:00.000
Wishing you the blessing of children.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.632
Wishing you the blessing of children.

00:47:01.672 --> 00:47:03.464
Wishing you the blessing of children.

00:47:03.488 --> 00:47:05.144
Wishing you the blessing of children.

00:47:05.176 --> 00:47:06.368
Wishing you the blessing of children.

00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:10.184
Hello, everyone.

00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:15.904
I miss you. I miss you.

00:47:15.928 --> 00:47:18.160
Officer, you need to help my friend.

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:20.160
I want to help her.

00:47:20.184 --> 00:47:20.712
But right now,

00:47:20.728 --> 00:47:23.040
I have no evidence to charge them with.

00:47:23.064 --> 00:47:24.624
If we let things go on like this,

00:47:24.656 --> 00:47:26.464
won’t it be more dangerous to Ploy?

00:47:26.496 --> 00:47:27.984
Then we have to do this.

00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:31.432
Why did the lights suddenly go off?

00:47:31.448 --> 00:47:32.968
What are you doing?

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:35.040
Let me go.

00:47:35.072 --> 00:47:38.696
If you are gone, Ploy will be mine.
