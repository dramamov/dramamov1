00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.400
My Lady.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.080
Master.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:17.890
Where is the young lady?

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:18.860
The young lady isn't here.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.700
She left a letter. She's gone.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:22.920
I won't marry.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.590
That foolish girl.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.200
Go find her now.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.000
Yes, sir.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:32.910
Hya!

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.000
Hya!

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.160
Cai Ping.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.200
Cai Ping?

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:53.480
Cai Ping!

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.130
Five!

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.390
Thank goodness you're still alive!

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.550
Five is indeed alive.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.070
But the Imperial Advisor's heart

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:11.660
is nearly dying from heartache.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:12.670
Nonsense.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.300
How would you know
about the Imperial Advisor?

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:18.450
You are the Imperial Advisor?

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.410
Five, how could you
be the Imperial Advisor?

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:21.610
If I wanted to,

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:22.950
I could even be the emperor.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:24.560
But the emperor has so little freedom.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.290
He can't take his wife
to travel and enjoy the scenery.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:28.270
Besides,

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.500
my wife doesn't seem to want to marry me.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.610
Well, who told you

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.920
to propose without telling me first?

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.400
So you admit you're my wife

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.260
and willing to marry me?

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.330
No, I'm not.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:44.230
You're tricking me. That doesn't count.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.790
Yingying,

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.480
now Daning is peaceful and prosperous.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.640
Nothing can ever separate us again.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.940
Let me formally ask you once more:

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.630
Will you marry me?

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:04.210
If you are unwilling,

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:06.130
I'll have to force you.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.740
You still don't know, do you?

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.440
I'm stubborn by nature

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:10.560
and quite jealous.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:11.870
If you provoke me,

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.660
you're in big trouble.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.030
Yes, I will.
