WEEKLY CINEMA

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:44.044
THE GODDESS OF THE MAINLAND
ACTOR MARY YOO

00:00:44.128 --> 00:00:45.087
Mary Yoo?

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.173
I've never heard of that name before.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.176
"Mary Yoo is
not that well-known in Korea."

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:52.386
"Influenced by her father
of Hong Kong nationality,

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.264
she first debuted in China
and became a Chinese goddess."

00:00:55.347 --> 00:00:59.226
"She's currently looking for her first…"

00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:04.607
"She's looking for her first movie?"

00:01:11.363 --> 00:01:12.782
Oh, it's him.

00:01:12.865 --> 00:01:13.783
It's him.

00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:17.536
Yes, Mr. Ha.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.374
Director Kim,
have you decided on the female lead yet?

00:01:22.458 --> 00:01:23.501
Not yet.

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:25.419
I'm busy because of that right now.

00:01:25.503 --> 00:01:28.464
Really? Then for the female lead--

00:01:28.547 --> 00:01:29.799
Sorry, I'll call you back.

00:01:29.882 --> 00:01:31.008
Hello?

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:32.885
Hello?

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:39.475
Director Kim!

00:01:39.558 --> 00:01:40.518
EPISODE 10

00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:41.727
-Director Kim!
-Mr. Ha.

00:01:45.314 --> 00:01:47.733
She's not well-known in Korea yet,

00:01:47.817 --> 00:01:50.694
but she's already a goddess in China.

00:01:50.778 --> 00:01:52.988
I was thinking
maybe she could play the lead role?

00:01:54.782 --> 00:01:56.325
Oh, man.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.494
What?

00:01:58.577 --> 00:02:00.120
My goodness, Mr. Ha.

00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:03.332
Are you kidding me?

00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:04.792
What?

00:02:05.668 --> 00:02:08.254
We have so much in common.

00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:12.883
We actually got in touch with Mary Yoo,
so we were arranging the schedule.

00:02:12.967 --> 00:02:13.926
Really?

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:15.970
Wow, that's great!

00:02:16.554 --> 00:02:19.348
I'm touched that
you're so happy like it's your own deal

00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:22.476
and that you're worried
about it like it's your own deal.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.853
It couldn't be more touching.

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:28.232
This is no big deal.
You know we're more than that.

00:02:31.277 --> 00:02:33.153
-About Mary Yoo.
-Yes.

00:02:33.237 --> 00:02:34.530
She has a natural-born talent.

00:02:34.613 --> 00:02:36.824
She's a third-generation Korean,
so she's fluent in Korean.

00:02:36.907 --> 00:02:38.659
She's also fluent in English.

00:02:38.742 --> 00:02:41.161
It's only a matter of time
until she makes it to Hollywood.

00:02:41.245 --> 00:02:43.998
However, one thing that bothers me

00:02:44.707 --> 00:02:47.543
is that every time she stars in a work,
she gets involved in a scandal.

00:02:47.626 --> 00:02:49.420
Oh, with the male lead?

00:02:50.963 --> 00:02:54.258
With the investor who invested the most.

00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:05.269
But it's up to the investor to be careful.

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:06.770
Of course.

00:03:09.607 --> 00:03:10.482
Shall we get going?

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.776
Where are we going?

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.736
To meet Mary Yoo.

00:03:14.653 --> 00:03:15.654
Mary Yoo?

00:03:15.738 --> 00:03:16.614
-Of course.
-Now?

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.199
She's coming on a night flight,
so we have to go now.

00:03:19.283 --> 00:03:20.117
Let's go.

00:03:22.453 --> 00:03:23.370
Okay.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.682
Aren't these flowers for me?

00:04:25.474 --> 00:04:28.644
With the investor who invested the most.

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:33.482
Oh, yes.

00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:41.991
Thank you.

00:04:57.756 --> 00:04:59.299
Give us a call.

00:04:59.383 --> 00:05:00.759
We'll be waiting for good news.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.094
Sure.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.805
Looking forward to working with you.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:07.725
Sure.

00:05:42.718 --> 00:05:44.595
MADAM GANGSTER

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:47.723
CEO HA JUNG-HO

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:50.350
It's him.

00:05:52.436 --> 00:05:53.395
Yes, Mr. Ha.

00:05:54.438 --> 00:05:55.272
The investment…

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.361
I will do it.

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:03.906
He'll invest in us.

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:06.241
Quiet!

00:06:08.786 --> 00:06:10.704
Tell him I'm available tonight.

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:12.414
Hey.

00:06:14.333 --> 00:06:16.710
But under one condition.

00:06:18.504 --> 00:06:19.505
What?

00:06:20.255 --> 00:06:21.090
What?

00:06:22.591 --> 00:06:23.425
What?

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:27.054
Can we meet now?

00:06:30.307 --> 00:06:32.267
James is back. James!

00:06:32.351 --> 00:06:33.185
He's back.

00:06:34.186 --> 00:06:35.938
-James, how did it go?
-What did he say?

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:37.272
What are his conditions?

00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:40.275
Did he ask you
to set up a meeting with me?

00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:41.610
Just tell him okay. I'll do it.

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:42.611
I doubt it.

00:06:42.694 --> 00:06:43.946
He's not like that.

00:06:44.613 --> 00:06:46.073
-What?
-What do you mean?

00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:49.660
He's unnecessarily serious about movies.

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:51.453
He told me to change the whole script.

00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:53.413
-What?
-What?

00:06:53.497 --> 00:06:55.666
He gave us 167 revisions to make!

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:56.583
MADAME OH'S HEYDAYS

00:06:59.378 --> 00:07:02.131
If there are 167 revisions,
that means we have to rewrite it.

00:07:02.214 --> 00:07:03.215
Seriously.

00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:07.219
"Change the title."

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:09.513
"Produced by Haha Jungho
Fisheries Distribution."

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:10.931
It's so lame.

00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:12.975
"Check for action details."

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:14.268
"Reexamine the time period."

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:16.353
"Lack of probability
in the lead character's behavior

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:18.897
-and too many clichés."
-Stop!

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.527
We don't have time to fix everything.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.778
Okay?

00:07:24.862 --> 00:07:28.407
How about we tell him
we're changing the scenario to buy time

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:29.908
and take off when we get the money?

00:07:29.992 --> 00:07:30.826
Never.

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:32.786
-Why not?
-Why not?

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.291
He'll postpone the investment
until he approves the script himself.

00:07:39.543 --> 00:07:43.338
Ha Jung-ho's really serious about movies.

00:07:43.422 --> 00:07:46.508
Gosh, he should've been serious
about not ripping off the consumers.

00:07:46.592 --> 00:07:48.594
Where do we start?

00:07:49.261 --> 00:07:50.429
First, the title…

00:07:53.307 --> 00:07:54.892
No matter how much we change it,

00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:57.519
we'll never get the script
Ha Jung-ho approves.

00:07:57.603 --> 00:08:01.190
He'll postpone the investment
until he sees the script he approves.

00:08:01.273 --> 00:08:02.316
What do we do about that?

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:03.984
Hey.

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:08.572
A baby who just took his first step
into the film industry is excited.

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.407
We should play along.

00:08:11.283 --> 00:08:12.201
What?

00:08:13.327 --> 00:08:15.954
Give him a chance to play
the buk and janggu?

00:08:16.038 --> 00:08:17.331
That's right.

00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:25.589
Can't you hear that rhythm?

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:28.258
You don't hear
this traditional Korean rhythm?

00:08:28.342 --> 00:08:29.384
Do you hear it?

00:08:29.468 --> 00:08:30.385
What are you two doing?

00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:31.345
What's wrong with you?

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:44.608
Ha Jung-ho's car set off.

00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:45.776
I'll tail him.

00:08:46.652 --> 00:08:47.694
HAHA JUNGHO

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:51.990
Ha Jung-ho's going to his office.

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:55.535
Ha Jung-ho's moving.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:57.829
Ha Jung-ho's back.

00:08:59.623 --> 00:09:00.624
Ha Jung-ho's leaving.

00:09:03.919 --> 00:09:05.045
Ha Jung-ho's going in.

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:09.341
Ha Jung-ho just got home.

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.017
MADAM GANGSTER
CONFIDENTIAL

00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:47.546
Oh, hello.

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:48.755
It's us, Mr. Ha.

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:52.843
Hey there!

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:54.636
-Welcome.
-Hello.

00:09:55.262 --> 00:09:58.015
Mr. Ha, thank you
for letting us work here.

00:09:58.098 --> 00:10:02.185
Because our job is highly confidential,
we had to ask you a favor.

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:04.896
I hope we're not causing you any trouble
by visiting you unexpectedly.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.189
Oh, come on.

00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:08.817
What do you mean, trouble?

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.237
This was my proposal,
so I should take responsibility for it.

00:10:12.321 --> 00:10:14.281
-Follow me.
-You have a nice place.

00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:15.866
Thanks, come in.

00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:21.663
Billy Wilder,
one of the greatest minds in film history,

00:10:21.747 --> 00:10:26.001
said that 80 percent of a movie
is determined by the script.

00:10:27.753 --> 00:10:32.174
The outcome of the movie
rests in our hands.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.927
I wasn't aware
of such a good quote by Mr. Wilder.

00:10:36.011 --> 00:10:38.013
Scripts are important. Of course!

00:10:39.014 --> 00:10:42.809
Mr. Ha, if only our movie
could get better,

00:10:42.893 --> 00:10:46.605
I'm more than happy to do this
as a director.

00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:50.734
I knew all film lovers
had so much in common.

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:52.027
Of course.

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:55.280
-Mr. Ha, I love it, too.
-Oh, yes.

00:10:55.364 --> 00:10:57.449
All right. Shall we get started?

00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:04.581
-Is that Mary Yoo?
-What?

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:07.626
Are you saying that's the storyboard?

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:10.128
That?

00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:14.883
Mary Yoo dashes out of the boutique.

00:11:16.093 --> 00:11:17.761
Mary Yoo runs out!

00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:20.514
MADAME OH'S HEYDAYS

00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:22.474
Madame Oh's Heydays.

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:25.394
Isn't that the perfect title?

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:28.397
I've worked so hard on this script,
and now everything has to be his way.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.065
That's just like Yeong-ja's Heydays.

00:11:30.148 --> 00:11:35.487
Bravo! The title is fantastic,
elegant, and sensational.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:36.905
That's impressive!

00:11:40.117 --> 00:11:42.077
Director Kim, do you not like it?

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.662
-No, that's freaking… I mean…
-What?

00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:45.455
That's fabulous.

00:11:45.539 --> 00:11:46.957
It's amazing.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.752
All right. Then, allow me
to explain it to you.

00:11:50.836 --> 00:11:54.256
Here, this is the scene
I consider most important.

00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:55.632
Oh, that's important.

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:57.634
It's the scene in front of Daehan Cinema.

00:11:57.717 --> 00:12:02.722
It's where Mary Yoo fights
about 20 gangsters.

00:12:04.433 --> 00:12:05.517
This is very important.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.394
I'm sorry to interrupt
something so important,

00:12:07.477 --> 00:12:09.646
but something important came up.

00:12:10.439 --> 00:12:12.232
-I have to use the restroom.
-Oh, the restroom.

00:12:12.315 --> 00:12:13.733
It's that way.

00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:17.279
Director Kim. Let me continue.

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:49.644
Not here.

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:55.108
Anything in the basement?

00:12:55.192 --> 00:12:57.819
A home theater, a golf simulator,
and a parking garage. That's all.

00:12:57.903 --> 00:12:59.404
There's no place to hide a painting.

00:12:59.488 --> 00:13:01.031
There was nothing upstairs.

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:02.741
Should we sound out Ha Jung-ho more?

00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:04.075
Should we? I'll do that.

00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:08.663
"Men pass out
every time Madame Oh passes."

00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:10.040
"While she's fighting,

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:14.461
the hostages dash out
of the bars and run to the exit."

00:13:19.132 --> 00:13:21.343
That's impressive.

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:23.595
Your imagination for a film
is outstanding.

00:13:27.224 --> 00:13:30.060
Well, speaking of imagination,

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:31.937
when you watch a movie,

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.023
every rich family has a secret room
in their houses, you know?

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:39.194
For example, like a shelter
in case of an earthquake.

00:13:39.277 --> 00:13:41.947
Do you have a space like that
in your house, too?

00:13:45.575 --> 00:13:47.118
A shelter?

00:13:47.202 --> 00:13:48.328
Yes.

00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:49.704
-A basement?
-Yes.

00:13:51.373 --> 00:13:52.249
A shelter?

00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:55.460
I regret not making one.

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:59.464
It's not like
this country is safe from earthquakes, so…

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:01.591
Darn it. He doesn't have one.

00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:05.303
Because you make movies,

00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:07.389
you're very imaginative.

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:08.890
Right.

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:12.852
Because I was being
cinematically imaginative,

00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:14.980
I overstepped the boundaries.
I went too far.

00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:17.232
Don't worry. Let's continue.

00:14:17.816 --> 00:14:20.277
"Without missing him, she throws him down

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.237
and puts a knife against his neck…"

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.407
MADAME OH'S HEYDAYS

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.208
Maybe he sold it already.

00:14:35.292 --> 00:14:38.003
No, I haven't heard
that it was on the market.

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:40.922
There was nothing unusual
in Ha Jung-ho's movement.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:43.758
For goodness' sake,
where did he put that painting?

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:45.427
A painting!

00:14:46.303 --> 00:14:49.389
Does Ha Jung-ho, that punk,
even want to have the props as he pleases?

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:52.851
I bet he'll make a fuss
about directing, too.

00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:54.644
It's obvious.

00:14:55.145 --> 00:14:58.231
How dare he try to mess with props?

00:14:58.732 --> 00:14:59.566
Are you sleeping?

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:05.739
I didn't know Gu-ho had the skills
to communicate while sleeping.

00:15:06.323 --> 00:15:07.490
But you heard it, right?

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.577
Props.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.332
Sometimes, Gu-ho has a genius moment.

00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:16.541
Although it's very rare.

00:15:16.625 --> 00:15:17.667
You're right.

00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:18.877
Sleep tight.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.337
You piece of shit...

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:26.009
MADAME OH'S HEYDAYS

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:27.218
Okay. Are you ready?

00:15:27.886 --> 00:15:28.970
Here we go.

00:15:29.054 --> 00:15:31.765
All right. One, two, three.

00:15:40.482 --> 00:15:41.441
Have some tea.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.404
Nice.

00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:49.407
We're going to have a meal at Renaissance,

00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:51.701
have coffee, and go to the movies.

00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:54.954
Madame Oh, would you like to join us?

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:57.749
I would absolutely love to,

00:15:57.832 --> 00:16:01.252
but to complete your dresses
before the dinner with the officials,

00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:03.505
I won't have enough time,
even if I stay up all night.

00:16:03.588 --> 00:16:05.924
I feel so bad for you.

00:16:06.007 --> 00:16:08.176
Take me with you next time.

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:09.511
Of course.

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:12.347
Right. What do you want to watch, ma'am?

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:16.518
I hear Be Strong, Ji-hyeong
is popular lately.

00:16:16.601 --> 00:16:19.312
Oh, my. I love it.

00:16:19.396 --> 00:16:23.108
Speaking of which, where is that playing?

00:16:23.191 --> 00:16:25.860
At Daehan Cinema. Why do you ask?

00:16:25.944 --> 00:16:27.195
Are you coming?

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:29.531
It's not a good idea to go there tonight.

00:16:29.614 --> 00:16:30.699
-Why is that?
-Why not?

00:16:30.782 --> 00:16:31.950
Why? What's wrong?

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:36.913
I heard the West Gate Gang
is watching a movie there tonight.

00:16:38.248 --> 00:16:41.292
My goodness.
That could've been a disaster!

00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:44.003
We could have gotten killed
while watching a movie.

00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:45.296
Jeez, that's scary.

00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:02.272
-Yes!
-Fantastic!

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:04.691
That was perfect, Mary Yoo!

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:07.694
-Nice. Good job.
-Wow.

00:17:07.777 --> 00:17:09.904
Mary! I loved the look in your eyes!

00:17:10.572 --> 00:17:12.282
-It was fantastic.
-Thank you.

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:13.241
By the way, who is he?

00:17:13.324 --> 00:17:15.452
He's Mr. Ha Jung-ho
of Haha Jungho Fisheries Distribution.

00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:16.369
Hello.

00:17:16.453 --> 00:17:17.328
Director Kim.

00:17:17.412 --> 00:17:18.455
Mary Yoo, that was amazing.

00:17:19.289 --> 00:17:20.957
But the sunlight was too strong just now.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.625
I think I blinked a little.

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:25.628
-How do we film the Daehan Cinema scene?
-Is that okay?

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:27.005
I know that.

00:17:27.088 --> 00:17:30.175
Your blink was more appropriate
for Madame Oh's character development.

00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:32.218
-The next scene…
-I blinked for about 2.5 seconds.

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:33.428
No.

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:36.431
Mary, your eyes are the highlight.
You have such beautiful eyes.

00:17:36.514 --> 00:17:39.392
Everyone knows her eyes are beautiful.
Back up.

00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:41.227
-But there's a slight…
-I fell in love with…

00:17:41.311 --> 00:17:42.645
-Back up.
-They're beautiful.

00:17:42.729 --> 00:17:44.105
-Back up.
-They're amazing.

00:17:44.189 --> 00:17:45.565
-Back up.
-It's so noisy.

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:47.275
-She says you're noisy.
-It's so noisy.

00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:48.943
Director, are you ready?

00:17:49.027 --> 00:17:49.861
Okay.

00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:52.697
Director, are you ready?

00:17:52.781 --> 00:17:54.365
-Yes, all good.
-Okay.

00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:56.534
Director Kim, everything is ready.

00:17:57.202 --> 00:17:58.995
-Be quiet, jeez.
-Sorry.

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:00.246
I made them quiet.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:01.790
Be nice, jeez.

00:18:01.873 --> 00:18:03.166
Okay. I'll keep cool.

00:18:05.668 --> 00:18:07.128
Here we go.

00:18:07.212 --> 00:18:09.547
One, two, three.

00:18:12.926 --> 00:18:14.511
Hey!

00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:15.929
Don't cross.

00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:16.846
Don't get any closer.

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:20.266
Hey, stop.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.643
What brings you here?

00:18:24.229 --> 00:18:25.605
I'm here to watch a movie.

00:18:25.688 --> 00:18:27.106
Is there a problem?

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:29.901
We have a group watching.

00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:32.070
Not today, pretty lady.

00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:37.617
Oh, do thugs watch movies these days?

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:40.745
What in the…

00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:41.746
Hey, lady.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:45.875
You could be nice
and call us "gangsters," but thugs?

00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:49.462
Get the hell out of my sight now.
I don't go easy on women.

00:18:49.546 --> 00:18:51.256
Hear me? Get lost.

00:18:53.299 --> 00:18:54.634
Hey…

00:18:57.637 --> 00:18:59.556
I don't go easy on men, either.

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:01.724
Guys, come on!

00:19:11.025 --> 00:19:11.860
Come at me.

00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:21.578
Cut now?

00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:22.537
No.

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:30.920
Camera!

00:19:31.004 --> 00:19:32.839
Get close to her!

00:19:32.922 --> 00:19:35.300
Cameraman. Get closer. Film her closely.

00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:37.218
What the heck are you doing?

00:19:37.302 --> 00:19:38.678
I said, get in there now!

00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:40.972
Camera, come on. Get closer!

00:19:41.055 --> 00:19:43.057
This is the highlight of the movie!

00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:44.517
Are you going to waste it like that?

00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:45.602
Hey, fire him.

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:46.853
You go in! Now!

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:47.770
But…

00:19:49.522 --> 00:19:50.398
Gosh, seriously.

00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:53.860
Hey, this way.

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:57.530
-Good.
-That's what I'm talking about.

00:19:57.614 --> 00:19:58.823
They should've done that sooner.

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:05.747
Below.

00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:09.375
Hurry up and turn. Turn.

00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:12.754
The camera work is amazing.

00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:14.339
In 360 degrees.

00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:17.008
Should I watch it this way or this way?

00:20:17.091 --> 00:20:20.094
-That's the end of the century vibe.
-It's 360 degrees.

00:20:20.178 --> 00:20:21.763
-Wow, awesome.
-This is just wow.

00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:41.240
If you don't want to die,
tell me where you hid it.

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:46.245
The storage in the mountains
of Bokgang-ri…

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.849
Get out of here quickly.

00:21:06.933 --> 00:21:09.602
Can we go home now?

00:21:10.395 --> 00:21:12.772
Yes, you're free now.

00:21:12.855 --> 00:21:14.148
Really?

00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:15.942
-We're safe now.
-Hurry up.

00:21:16.025 --> 00:21:18.361
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:33.459
What a beautiful world this is!

00:21:34.836 --> 00:21:36.254
Good work.

00:21:36.337 --> 00:21:38.006
You could be a director yourself.

00:21:38.089 --> 00:21:40.049
That was the best scene, right?

00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:42.218
-You could be a director.
-Let's continue after the meal.

00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:43.136
Be quiet!

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.139
We just got the perfect scene.

00:21:49.058 --> 00:21:50.435
-Fire that guy.
-What…

00:21:50.518 --> 00:21:53.312
-How dare you interrupt Mr. Ha?
-Don't stop me.

00:21:53.396 --> 00:21:55.106
MADAME OH'S HEYDAYS

00:21:59.068 --> 00:22:00.028
Hey, Mary Yoo.

00:22:01.112 --> 00:22:03.239
Were you looking at the script?

00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:06.534
This is our biggest investor…

00:22:06.617 --> 00:22:10.663
No, the biggest investor-to-be,
no, you can basically say he is the one.

00:22:10.747 --> 00:22:13.416
This is our future investor,
Mr. Ha Jung-ho.

00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:15.626
Oh, really?

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:17.378
-Have a seat.
-Yes.

00:22:17.462 --> 00:22:18.796
Gosh, isn't her acting great?

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:22.925
I just loved the look in her eyes.

00:22:25.678 --> 00:22:27.055
Thank you.

00:22:30.892 --> 00:22:32.643
HAHA JUNGHO

00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:36.606
I just sent you the investment.

00:22:37.648 --> 00:22:38.566
Already?

00:22:38.649 --> 00:22:39.484
Yes.

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.820
DEPOSITED 4,000,000,000 WON

00:22:43.571 --> 00:22:45.156
My goodness. Thank you.

00:22:51.996 --> 00:22:52.830
Director Kim.

00:22:53.456 --> 00:22:56.250
-Yes.
-About the highlight.

00:22:56.334 --> 00:22:57.335
Which highlight?

00:22:57.418 --> 00:23:03.049
Oh, you mean the scene
where you meet the thug boss at the end?

00:23:03.132 --> 00:23:05.802
Oh, how do you know
the scenario that well?

00:23:07.929 --> 00:23:09.764
It's only the basics as an investor.

00:23:10.765 --> 00:23:12.016
I knew it.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.938
I was thinking
maybe we should have a symbolic painting

00:23:17.021 --> 00:23:22.777
to reflect the boss's psychology
in that scene.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.862
A mere thug wouldn't care
so much about a painting…

00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:30.159
Well…

00:23:31.202 --> 00:23:33.996
Like the night of a full moon?

00:23:34.997 --> 00:23:36.916
A full moon night?

00:23:36.999 --> 00:23:42.588
Either dark shadows
approaching a sacred castle,

00:23:42.672 --> 00:23:47.760
or praying or something?

00:23:48.427 --> 00:23:49.428
What?

00:23:50.054 --> 00:23:51.597
Full moon.

00:23:51.681 --> 00:23:53.099
The dark shadows.

00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:55.810
A sacred castle.

00:23:57.478 --> 00:23:58.938
A painting with all that…

00:24:04.277 --> 00:24:05.111
There is one.

00:24:05.736 --> 00:24:06.696
A perfect match for that.

00:24:07.238 --> 00:24:08.281
Really?

00:24:08.364 --> 00:24:09.740
Oh, my. Really?

00:24:09.824 --> 00:24:14.620
Yes, I have just the perfect painting
with that image, Mary Yoo!

00:24:17.832 --> 00:24:19.417
That's great news!

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.712
Oh, then can you sponsor it?

00:24:22.795 --> 00:24:24.589
Totally, Mary.

00:24:27.091 --> 00:24:28.634
That's awesome.

00:24:30.094 --> 00:24:31.095
But…

00:24:33.139 --> 00:24:34.765
under one condition.

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:37.185
One condition. Of course.

00:24:39.604 --> 00:24:41.022
The time has come.

00:24:41.647 --> 00:24:46.694
Oh, what kind of condition is that?

00:24:54.994 --> 00:24:56.078
I will…

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:00.082
play the thug boss.

00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:08.382
Yes, totally!

00:25:10.801 --> 00:25:13.054
You'll be perfect for it!

00:25:13.137 --> 00:25:15.556
What do you say? Isn't he perfect?
What do you say?

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.474
Director Kim?

00:25:17.099 --> 00:25:18.100
-Sure.
-Deal!

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:20.394
Mary?

00:25:20.478 --> 00:25:21.604
Please, Mary.

00:25:21.687 --> 00:25:23.898
Deal!

00:25:36.035 --> 00:25:37.370
We've found the painting.

00:25:37.453 --> 00:25:38.663
Finally.

00:25:38.746 --> 00:25:40.206
Where was it?

00:25:43.376 --> 00:25:44.627
At his second ex-wife's office.

00:25:45.461 --> 00:25:47.588
Oh, I didn't think that far.

00:25:47.672 --> 00:25:48.673
I know, right?

00:25:48.756 --> 00:25:52.802
"You should've just moved on
and lived well on your own."

00:25:52.885 --> 00:25:56.222
Mr. Ha, you look wonderful.

00:25:56.305 --> 00:25:58.057
Should I call you Boss?

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.893
-How are you?
-Oh, you look wonderful.

00:26:00.977 --> 00:26:03.020
It looks more perfect with the painting.

00:26:03.104 --> 00:26:04.689
-You think so?
-Thank you.

00:26:04.772 --> 00:26:06.440
You're welcome.
Let me get back to practice.

00:26:06.524 --> 00:26:07.650
For sure.

00:26:08.818 --> 00:26:13.155
"You should've just moved on
and lived well on your own."

00:26:13.239 --> 00:26:14.073
On your own.

00:26:14.156 --> 00:26:15.533
Ready.

00:27:14.592 --> 00:27:15.593
Found you.

00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:33.527
I've been waiting for you, Madame Oh.

00:27:34.362 --> 00:27:36.739
Jung-ho?

00:27:37.365 --> 00:27:39.075
Jung-ho, what are you doing here?

00:27:39.158 --> 00:27:43.579
You should've just moved on
and lived well on your own.

00:27:43.662 --> 00:27:46.582
Why did you have to make a fuss
about taking revenge

00:27:46.665 --> 00:27:48.626
when you couldn't even do it?

00:27:48.709 --> 00:27:52.588
Then, the body that was found
along with my dad's in the factory fire,

00:27:52.671 --> 00:27:53.881
that wasn't you?

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:57.718
Of course not.

00:27:57.802 --> 00:27:59.345
-I'm standing right here!
-Oh, my.

00:27:59.428 --> 00:28:01.013
Alive!

00:28:01.097 --> 00:28:03.182
I devoted my whole life

00:28:03.265 --> 00:28:07.061
to killing the boss of the West Gate Gang
that set the factory on fire.

00:28:07.144 --> 00:28:08.938
Why are you doing this to me?

00:28:09.021 --> 00:28:13.734
Even if I tell you the truth now,
what difference is that going to make?

00:28:13.818 --> 00:28:15.945
Just stick to being who you are

00:28:16.028 --> 00:28:18.489
and carry on, will you?

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:21.492
I can let go of what you did to me,

00:28:21.575 --> 00:28:23.953
but why did you have to be
so cruel to my dad,

00:28:24.036 --> 00:28:25.871
when he treated you like his own son?

00:28:25.955 --> 00:28:30.459
Money!

00:28:30.543 --> 00:28:32.545
What else could it be aside from money?

00:28:32.628 --> 00:28:33.838
Money can get me everything.

00:28:33.921 --> 00:28:38.175
For money, people are willing
to go to prison for me.

00:28:38.259 --> 00:28:42.346
Do you know
how many politicians I've bribed?

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:44.890
You think they'd just sit on their hands?

00:28:44.974 --> 00:28:48.769
You think I'd die that easily?

00:28:51.439 --> 00:28:54.817
I can't believe
I loved such a crazy moron.

00:29:01.782 --> 00:29:04.201
Stop going on about how you loved me.

00:29:04.285 --> 00:29:06.787
I'm sick of even making excuses.

00:29:07.621 --> 00:29:08.831
Now…

00:29:12.543 --> 00:29:16.380
Goodbye, Madame Oh!

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:33.898
Don't shoot!

00:29:33.981 --> 00:29:35.649
I'm sorry.

00:29:35.733 --> 00:29:40.863
I was blinded by money…

00:29:48.078 --> 00:29:53.918
Can you really shoot me?

00:30:07.264 --> 00:30:10.518
-Boss!
-Boss!

00:30:10.601 --> 00:30:11.560
What happened?

00:30:11.644 --> 00:30:12.978
Big Boss!

00:30:13.062 --> 00:30:14.396
Boss!

00:30:25.574 --> 00:30:28.077
Cut! Okay! The end of the shoot.

00:30:29.745 --> 00:30:31.080
Good work.

00:30:31.705 --> 00:30:33.415
Your acting was amazing!

00:30:34.083 --> 00:30:37.670
-Good work.
-Gosh, I loved your eyes.

00:30:37.753 --> 00:30:40.631
Oh, Mary Yoo. Great job.

00:30:40.714 --> 00:30:42.633
-I loved it.
-Thank you.

00:30:43.467 --> 00:30:45.803
-This is for you, Mr. Ha.
-What? Me too?

00:30:45.886 --> 00:30:48.055
You're guaranteed to win
the Male Rookie Award.

00:30:48.138 --> 00:30:50.724
Oh, stop it. You're flattering me.

00:30:50.808 --> 00:30:53.852
Let's give it up
for Mr. Ha for his hard work!

00:30:55.521 --> 00:30:57.356
That's all for the last shoot.

00:30:57.439 --> 00:30:59.525
We'll see you shortly at the after-party!
Good work!

00:30:59.608 --> 00:31:00.734
Good work.

00:31:00.818 --> 00:31:03.320
I'll send you the date
for the press conference later.

00:31:04.113 --> 00:31:05.489
-Good job.
-Good work.

00:31:05.573 --> 00:31:06.991
-Thank you.
-Thanks for your work.

00:31:07.074 --> 00:31:08.826
-Thank you for your work.
-Thank you.

00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:10.661
Mr. Ha.

00:31:10.744 --> 00:31:11.996
Thank you for your work.

00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:24.925
Why put on so much makeup
in the middle of the night?

00:31:25.009 --> 00:31:26.677
The shoot's over. We should drink to that.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.054
Ha Jung-ho wouldn't miss
his chance tonight.

00:31:29.138 --> 00:31:32.433
Why do you have to bring up that name?
He appalls me.

00:31:33.058 --> 00:31:36.270
Why do you think he was
so passionate about this project?

00:31:36.353 --> 00:31:39.064
Probably because
of his unaccomplished dream about cinema.

00:31:39.148 --> 00:31:40.065
Come on.

00:31:40.149 --> 00:31:45.195
It was to have Mary Yoo,
the beautiful woman from heaven.

00:31:45.279 --> 00:31:49.283
Don't tell me you haven't noticed
all that effort Ha Jung-ho made.

00:31:51.744 --> 00:31:52.578
Yes.

00:31:57.458 --> 00:32:00.002
If he asks me out for a drink,
I'll have just one drink.

00:32:00.085 --> 00:32:01.253
Never.

00:32:01.337 --> 00:32:02.171
Why not?

00:32:03.922 --> 00:32:05.924
He invested four billion won.

00:32:06.008 --> 00:32:08.135
I could get a dress
for the press conference tomorrow.

00:32:08.218 --> 00:32:09.178
Then I'll come with you.

00:32:09.261 --> 00:32:12.681
How can I let you go alone with that perv?

00:32:12.765 --> 00:32:13.724
I'll never allow it.

00:32:13.807 --> 00:32:15.267
It's going to be a hotel bar.

00:32:15.351 --> 00:32:17.144
Hotel bar or whatever, I said no.

00:32:19.688 --> 00:32:20.939
Wait. He's here.

00:32:21.023 --> 00:32:22.358
-Is he really here?
-Go.

00:32:23.442 --> 00:32:24.276
Me?

00:32:26.195 --> 00:32:27.738
-Good evening.
-Mr. Ha.

00:32:27.821 --> 00:32:29.281
-Have a seat.
-Thanks.

00:32:46.507 --> 00:32:49.259
I got you something to go
with your dress, Mary Yoo.

00:32:49.802 --> 00:32:51.220
Oh, my.

00:32:51.303 --> 00:32:52.388
What is all this?

00:32:55.349 --> 00:32:57.017
Oh, this is beautiful.

00:32:58.227 --> 00:33:00.813
Darn that wealthy snob.

00:33:00.896 --> 00:33:02.022
Then?

00:33:02.981 --> 00:33:04.400
Shall we go out for a drink?

00:33:05.693 --> 00:33:07.820
What's with that attitude?

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.074
Well, give me a moment.

00:33:12.741 --> 00:33:16.328
Seeing this necklace,
I have the perfect dress to go with it.

00:33:16.412 --> 00:33:18.247
Let me get changed.

00:33:19.957 --> 00:33:24.211
No, you must be tired from shooting.

00:33:29.049 --> 00:33:30.008
Director Kim.

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:32.845
Yes?

00:33:35.723 --> 00:33:37.391
Do you want to go out for a drink?

00:33:41.353 --> 00:33:42.229
What? With me?

00:33:42.312 --> 00:33:43.605
-With him?
-Why?

00:33:43.689 --> 00:33:45.816
From the first moment I saw you,

00:33:45.899 --> 00:33:49.528
I knew you were a good person.

00:33:50.195 --> 00:33:52.614
My first impression is never wrong.

00:33:53.115 --> 00:33:54.992
I think it is wrong.

00:34:08.297 --> 00:34:11.550
Director Kim. That's great!

00:34:19.308 --> 00:34:25.272
I knew all film lovers
had so much in common.

00:34:25.939 --> 00:34:27.775
Of course, Mr. Ha.

00:34:28.567 --> 00:34:30.778
All right. Action!

00:34:35.574 --> 00:34:39.411
The energy you poured
into the film was extraordinary.

00:34:39.912 --> 00:34:41.914
It wasn't that extraordinary.

00:34:55.928 --> 00:35:00.098
Perhaps we could be fantastic partners.

00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:06.563
What do you mean by partners?

00:35:09.399 --> 00:35:14.613
I plan to invest more in cinema.

00:35:14.696 --> 00:35:17.407
Wow. That's a great idea, sure.

00:35:17.491 --> 00:35:20.786
If you get to know me,
there's nothing to lose.

00:35:20.869 --> 00:35:22.538
I already lost…

00:35:22.621 --> 00:35:24.373
Wait. That's right.

00:35:24.456 --> 00:35:26.500
Mr. Ha, I have to edit…

00:35:28.502 --> 00:35:30.045
It won't take long, Director Kim.

00:35:31.463 --> 00:35:33.382
Director Ha… I mean, Mr. Ha!

00:35:33.465 --> 00:35:35.509
I'll treat you big time later.

00:35:35.592 --> 00:35:36.468
Mary Yoo. Goodnight.

00:35:36.552 --> 00:35:38.053
-Sure.
-Director Kim.

00:35:39.054 --> 00:35:40.138
-Director Kim.
-No.

00:35:41.807 --> 00:35:43.141
For goodness' sake.

00:35:44.184 --> 00:35:46.728
Director Kim!

00:35:47.229 --> 00:35:48.939
Director Kim.

00:35:49.857 --> 00:35:51.108
Director Kim.

00:35:51.191 --> 00:35:52.818
Can we have just one drink?

00:35:52.901 --> 00:35:54.194
Just one.

00:35:54.278 --> 00:35:55.237
Come here.

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.780
I just have something to say.

00:35:56.864 --> 00:35:58.991
-No, I can't…
-Come here.

00:35:59.074 --> 00:36:00.325
This way, please.

00:36:00.409 --> 00:36:01.618
Come this way.

00:36:01.702 --> 00:36:03.078
Hey, not that way.

00:36:06.748 --> 00:36:09.293
Wow, is that why he got divorced twice?

00:36:10.627 --> 00:36:12.629
No, my Gu-ho. I have to protect him.

00:36:12.713 --> 00:36:13.839
My Gu-ho.

00:36:13.922 --> 00:36:15.007
Gu-ho!

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:16.842
Don't let him catch you.

00:36:16.925 --> 00:36:18.176
Never!

00:36:19.928 --> 00:36:21.805
MADAME OH'S HEYDAYS
VIP PRESS CONFERENCE

00:36:22.431 --> 00:36:26.393
MADAME OH'S HEYDAYS

00:36:31.982 --> 00:36:34.109
Can you look to the right?

00:36:36.278 --> 00:36:37.779
Look to the left, please.

00:36:40.073 --> 00:36:41.700
Oh, hello.

00:36:43.035 --> 00:36:44.036
Yes.

00:36:44.119 --> 00:36:45.078
Look who it is!

00:36:45.162 --> 00:36:46.872
-Mr. Ha!
-Congressman Choi!

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.875
-Lawyer Park.
-Congratulations.

00:36:49.958 --> 00:36:51.668
Thank you so much for coming.

00:36:51.752 --> 00:36:52.794
Of course, I had to come.

00:36:52.878 --> 00:36:54.212
Oh, that's right.

00:36:54.296 --> 00:36:56.798
This is the lead actress. Mary Yoo.

00:36:56.882 --> 00:36:59.009
Oh, she's gorgeous.

00:36:59.635 --> 00:37:01.428
-And this is our director.
-Hello.

00:37:01.511 --> 00:37:03.263
And this is the producer.

00:37:03.347 --> 00:37:04.389
Good work.

00:37:04.473 --> 00:37:05.807
I'll enjoy watching.

00:37:05.891 --> 00:37:07.309
-Let's go.
-Okay.

00:37:09.269 --> 00:37:12.230
When this movie ends,
a whole new world will begin for you.

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:14.983
You think so?

00:37:15.067 --> 00:37:17.736
I'm so nervous.

00:37:17.819 --> 00:37:18.654
Let's go.

00:37:25.702 --> 00:37:26.620
Stay tuned.

00:37:34.002 --> 00:37:35.003
Taffies.

00:37:57.734 --> 00:38:00.278
MADAME OH'S HEYDAYS

00:38:00.362 --> 00:38:01.405
What the?

00:38:01.488 --> 00:38:02.572
Where's my face…

00:38:03.073 --> 00:38:03.949
What is that?

00:38:05.826 --> 00:38:07.953
That can be edited again.

00:38:08.036 --> 00:38:12.207
Gosh, do I have to edit it myself?

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:24.094
I like that angle.

00:38:27.514 --> 00:38:30.851
If you don't want to die,
tell me where you hid it.

00:38:32.686 --> 00:38:34.646
-The storage in the mountains…
-It's starting now.

00:38:40.444 --> 00:38:42.988
HAHA JUNGHO FISHERIES DISTRIBUTION

Don't rip the boxes
when you change the labels!

00:38:56.877 --> 00:38:59.546
Look what you've done! We can't use this!

00:38:59.629 --> 00:39:01.006
Be more careful!

00:39:01.965 --> 00:39:03.008
Man, I'm serious!

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:11.308

HAHA JUNGHO

Even if I tell you the truth now,
what difference is that going to make?

00:39:19.816 --> 00:39:24.321
Just stick to being who you are
and carry on, will you?

00:39:26.823 --> 00:39:27.657
Hello, sir.

00:39:28.658 --> 00:39:29.868
How much did we get today?

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:31.536
We got three trucks.

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.371
Change the labels before distributing.

00:39:33.455 --> 00:39:34.623
Get back to work.

00:39:42.005 --> 00:39:44.216
Oh, let's drink.

00:39:45.509 --> 00:39:48.303
That elementary school
food poisoning incident.

00:39:48.887 --> 00:39:49.888
Was that your work?

00:39:52.265 --> 00:39:53.475
I'm ashamed, Congressman Choi.

00:39:53.558 --> 00:39:57.729
Come on. Why so discouraged
over something so trivial?

00:39:57.813 --> 00:39:59.773
Just put the blame on your subcontractor.

00:40:00.398 --> 00:40:01.775
-Put the blame?
-Yes.

00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:05.612
Oh, I could put the blame on them!

00:40:05.695 --> 00:40:06.530
That's a good idea!

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.408
You're truly amazing! One second.

00:40:10.909 --> 00:40:13.745
I've brought something for all of you.

00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:16.414
LAWYER PARK, REPORTER HAN,
CEO HA, CONGRESSMAN CHOI

00:40:16.915 --> 00:40:18.792

Lawyer Park.

00:40:20.794 --> 00:40:21.920
Reporter Han.

00:40:22.003 --> 00:40:22.963
Let's drink.

00:40:23.046 --> 00:40:24.422
-Sure.
-Oh, yes.

00:40:24.923 --> 00:40:27.300

-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:40:32.764 --> 00:40:36.685
Do you know
how many politicians I've bribed?

00:40:36.768 --> 00:40:40.522
Money!

00:40:40.605 --> 00:40:42.983
HA JUNG-HO'S HEYDAYS

00:40:45.527 --> 00:40:46.361
Oh, no.

00:40:48.738 --> 00:40:51.074
Let's never see each other again.

00:40:51.867 --> 00:40:53.994
How dare you repay my kindness like this?

00:40:56.663 --> 00:40:57.539
No pictures.

00:40:57.622 --> 00:40:59.457

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:01.209
Where are you going?

00:41:01.293 --> 00:41:02.961
-No pictures.
-Move.

00:41:20.437 --> 00:41:22.731
What the hell is this? I'm doomed!

00:41:22.814 --> 00:41:26.276
I want to go back!

00:41:31.781 --> 00:41:32.908
Over there. Put it there.

00:41:37.412 --> 00:41:38.580
Thank you.

00:41:38.663 --> 00:41:40.123
Thank you so much.

00:41:40.207 --> 00:41:41.875
You've been through so much.

00:41:42.626 --> 00:41:45.378
I felt bad after hearing
what happened to you.

00:41:45.462 --> 00:41:47.339
I'm glad I can assist in this way.

00:41:47.881 --> 00:41:48.715
Oh, right.

00:41:51.092 --> 00:41:54.262
We have a gift for you.
This isn't much, but I hope you enjoy it.

00:41:54.346 --> 00:41:55.847
Oh, you didn't have to.

00:41:55.931 --> 00:41:57.349
Bye now.

00:41:57.432 --> 00:41:58.308
Enjoy.

00:41:58.391 --> 00:42:01.186
-Come on, let's go!
-Let's go!

00:42:35.262 --> 00:42:37.889
-My goodness!
-Sir, are you all right?

00:42:37.973 --> 00:42:40.016
-Are you okay?
-What happened?

00:42:42.018 --> 00:42:43.645
-What is all this?
-What?

00:42:43.728 --> 00:42:46.856
-What is going on?
-How much is all this?

00:43:02.414 --> 00:43:05.583
YOUR MOVIE WHERE YOU ARE THE LEAD

00:43:05.667 --> 00:43:10.547
A WONDERFUL HAPPY ENDING

ARCHITECT KANG YO-SEOP
STUDIED IN GERMANY

00:43:58.178 --> 00:43:59.971
Fuck.

00:44:08.813 --> 00:44:10.231
Son of a bitch.

00:44:12.984 --> 00:44:15.403
YU KANG-IL
SPECIAL EXHIBITION: TO EXIST

00:44:31.628 --> 00:44:34.089
I've found the painting
that you've wanted.

00:44:35.548 --> 00:44:39.928
Isn't it about time to stop
playing the charade and show yourself?

00:44:46.476 --> 00:44:48.895
The strong colors and bold brushstrokes

00:44:48.978 --> 00:44:52.899
in this work by the late Yu Kang-il
are captivating.

00:44:52.982 --> 00:44:56.694
Please take a moment to appreciate it.

00:45:09.332 --> 00:45:10.667
This painting…

00:45:28.351 --> 00:45:30.311
Hello, Professor Kang Yo-seop.

00:45:30.395 --> 00:45:31.229
Hello.

00:45:33.857 --> 00:45:36.484
I'm quite interested in this painting.

00:45:37.318 --> 00:45:38.278
I see.

00:45:58.548 --> 00:46:01.426
Because it's a painting
by late Yu Kang-il,

00:46:01.509 --> 00:46:03.678
a lot of people like it.

00:46:06.931 --> 00:46:08.057
Thank you.

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:20.278
Kang Yo-seop.

00:46:21.154 --> 00:46:22.864
We've finally met.

00:46:25.033 --> 00:46:28.953
Everything I've done until now
was just a small game to get near you.

00:46:30.288 --> 00:46:33.708
The game we've been playing
isn't over yet.

00:46:35.627 --> 00:46:39.506
The real game begins now.

00:46:45.386 --> 00:46:50.266
That was a wonderful lecture
by the CEO of Josef Architects.

00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:55.396
Lastly, we'll listen to his final comment
before we go.

00:46:56.689 --> 00:46:59.192
PLAN UTOPIA
PROFESSOR KANG YO-SEOP'S LECTURE

00:47:01.569 --> 00:47:06.074
A city is a mirror
that reflects human society.

00:47:06.783 --> 00:47:08.201
The gap between the rich and the poor,

00:47:08.284 --> 00:47:11.621
the desire for power,
and the desire for possession.

00:47:11.704 --> 00:47:14.082
They are all naturally woven
into the city.

00:47:14.916 --> 00:47:18.086
So I thought, "What if I change the city?"

00:47:18.753 --> 00:47:21.923
"What if I design a space
where every person can be equally happy?"

00:47:22.799 --> 00:47:25.677
Wouldn't that help change our minds
in which we're becoming

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.763
more and more personalized,
consumption-oriented,

00:47:28.846 --> 00:47:30.974
and exasperatingly competitive?

00:47:33.393 --> 00:47:36.437
That's why I wrote Plan Utopia.

00:47:38.565 --> 00:47:39.566
Any questions?

00:47:45.071 --> 00:47:46.781
In this book,

00:47:46.864 --> 00:47:50.743
you wrote that your childhood was worse
than simply growing up in a poor family.

00:47:50.827 --> 00:47:54.289
I wonder how you overcame
that environment.

00:47:55.665 --> 00:47:58.793
They say wealthy kids learn
how to open the door,

00:47:58.876 --> 00:48:02.005
while poor kids learn
how to jump over the fence.

00:48:06.759 --> 00:48:08.011
You have to eat up.

00:48:08.094 --> 00:48:09.470
My family was so poor growing up

00:48:09.554 --> 00:48:12.599
that we didn't even have a door
or a fence to jump over.

00:48:12.682 --> 00:48:13.850
Here. Eat up.

00:48:15.018 --> 00:48:18.229
Your husband is home. Damn it.

00:48:18.313 --> 00:48:20.023
How dare a woman…

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:25.236
Don't open the door
until I tell you to, okay?

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.237
Okay.

00:48:26.321 --> 00:48:28.281
You think I'm a joke?

00:48:28.948 --> 00:48:30.533
Where are you?

00:48:32.035 --> 00:48:33.661
Hey!

00:48:41.753 --> 00:48:42.587
Hey!

00:48:44.047 --> 00:48:47.133
Why was I born
into such an unfortunate family?

00:48:47.216 --> 00:48:48.676
I couldn't stand it.

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:53.848
The world gave everyone
a different starting line.

00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:58.478
Unfortunately,
the world is an unfair place.

00:49:00.104 --> 00:49:01.898
If I can't open the door,

00:49:01.981 --> 00:49:03.775
if I must work hard
to jump over the fence,

00:49:03.858 --> 00:49:05.902
I thought I might as well
destroy the fence.

00:49:07.153 --> 00:49:09.489
Well, it wasn't anything amazing.

00:49:09.572 --> 00:49:12.075
But I decided to go study in Germany.

00:49:13.284 --> 00:49:15.912
Were you on a government scholarship?

00:49:17.538 --> 00:49:21.167
I had to work part-time
when other people were studying.

00:49:23.294 --> 00:49:25.672
I had to work to survive.

00:49:26.464 --> 00:49:29.133
Desperation was my life at the time.

00:49:33.054 --> 00:49:34.847
-Me!
-Me!

00:49:34.931 --> 00:49:36.891
-Who wants to touch the pigeon?
-Me!

00:49:39.018 --> 00:49:39.894
Here.

00:49:46.275 --> 00:49:48.861
To me, studying abroad
wasn't a simple choice,

00:49:48.945 --> 00:49:52.365
but the only way
to overcome the unfair world.

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:56.035
So, I decided to play a new game

00:49:57.078 --> 00:49:58.538
for myself.

00:49:59.997 --> 00:50:02.125
Because my GPA wasn't high enough,

00:50:02.208 --> 00:50:07.130
I missed the government scholarship,
but I got to tutor a child.

00:50:07.839 --> 00:50:11.300
She was a successor
of a major corporation you all know.

00:50:16.848 --> 00:50:17.724
Too bad.

00:50:18.683 --> 00:50:19.892
I won again.

00:50:25.064 --> 00:50:26.691
It wasn't easy to teach her

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:29.444
because she was a mischievous girl.

00:50:29.527 --> 00:50:31.738
But thanks to her,
I secured the budget to study abroad.

00:50:32.572 --> 00:50:33.656
And the child…

00:50:37.785 --> 00:50:39.871
got to learn the real world.

00:50:43.458 --> 00:50:46.335
If there aren't any more questions,
how about we end the lecture here?

00:50:47.086 --> 00:50:47.920
Professor?

00:50:51.174 --> 00:50:52.467
Professor Kang Yo-seop.

00:50:54.761 --> 00:50:55.595
You may speak.

00:50:59.891 --> 00:51:04.187
I'm curious about your ultimate goal.

00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:10.359
That's perfect for the last question.

00:51:11.319 --> 00:51:12.487
Just as the title says.

00:51:13.237 --> 00:51:15.948
I want to plan
and embody a new type of city

00:51:16.032 --> 00:51:18.367
that meets the human instinct.

00:51:19.243 --> 00:51:22.371
But who knows?
No one knows if I'd be given that chance.

00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:27.210
That's all for my lecture. Thank you.

00:51:39.889 --> 00:51:42.308
Chief Kang, I enjoyed reading your book.

00:51:42.391 --> 00:51:43.601
-You finished it already?
-Yes.

00:51:43.684 --> 00:51:46.103
-I read it five times.
-You're lying.

00:51:46.187 --> 00:51:47.188
-I'm not.
-Picture?

00:51:55.822 --> 00:51:58.407
-I really enjoyed your lecture.
-Thank you.

00:52:00.952 --> 00:52:02.620
Just wait.

00:52:03.329 --> 00:52:04.622
It's my turn now.

00:52:08.417 --> 00:52:09.585
James.

00:52:09.669 --> 00:52:14.715
When I first arrived in Seoul, I never
thought I'd get to do a job like this.

00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:16.759
So? Do you regret it?

00:52:16.843 --> 00:52:18.344
No!

00:52:18.427 --> 00:52:20.388
I think this is great.

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:24.058
And I'm very thankful to you and Yi-rang.

00:52:25.601 --> 00:52:27.103
Thank you, James.

00:52:27.186 --> 00:52:30.064
Jeez, don't be cringy. Stop it.

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:32.567
TOTAL -58,590,500

00:52:32.650 --> 00:52:33.484
What is that?

00:52:34.527 --> 00:52:37.446
Negative 58,590,500 won?

00:52:37.572 --> 00:52:40.074
Gosh, I should've listened
to Mr. Mustache.

00:52:40.157 --> 00:52:42.785
Why did I bother getting the red carpet?
It's a loss.

00:52:42.869 --> 00:52:44.328
Does Yi-rang know about this?

00:52:44.412 --> 00:52:45.288
No, she doesn't.

00:52:46.873 --> 00:52:50.585
Where on earth did she go
when things are this serious?

00:52:51.335 --> 00:52:52.795
James, do you know anything?

00:52:52.879 --> 00:52:54.297
What?

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:55.381
Yes.

00:52:55.464 --> 00:52:57.383
I mean, no, I don't know.

00:53:03.556 --> 00:53:05.308
Is the laundry done?

00:53:10.771 --> 00:53:12.189
But you just did the laundry.

00:53:14.108 --> 00:53:16.193
There's something between the two.

00:53:18.446 --> 00:53:21.782
That reminds me
how this operation was pretty strange.

00:53:21.866 --> 00:53:23.492
A full moon night?

00:53:23.576 --> 00:53:29.123
Either dark shadows
approaching a sacred castle,

00:53:29.707 --> 00:53:34.295
or praying or something?

00:53:34.962 --> 00:53:37.924
I mean, a painting out of nowhere?
That was strange.

00:53:38.007 --> 00:53:41.093
And the fact that she sent us to
Ha Jung-ho's place just to fix the script.

00:53:50.770 --> 00:53:55.816
Late Yu Kang-il's last painting
discovered by a critic 20 years ago

00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:59.028
is finally displayed at Dana Art Museum.

00:53:59.111 --> 00:54:03.282
Artist Yu Kang-il
was evaluated matchless among the artists,

00:54:03.366 --> 00:54:07.119
but he suddenly ceased performing
and was forgotten by the public.

00:54:33.312 --> 00:54:34.897
GIL BEAUTY

00:54:37.692 --> 00:54:39.276
LEE SEON-MI

00:54:53.249 --> 00:54:57.378
MYUNG JIN-SU

00:55:00.506 --> 00:55:02.633
Dad…

00:55:11.517 --> 00:55:12.685
Yun Yi-rang.

00:55:14.311 --> 00:55:17.732
What is all this?

00:55:22.153 --> 00:55:26.115
Why is everyone we worked on
all connected?

00:55:30.244 --> 00:55:34.790
And... why is my dad on this?

00:55:38.335 --> 00:55:39.336
Tell me.

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:42.798
Why is my dad…

00:55:42.882 --> 00:55:45.009
Why is he connected to them?

00:55:47.303 --> 00:55:48.304
Tell me.

00:55:51.515 --> 00:55:53.726
Your father was one of the victims.

00:55:59.815 --> 00:56:00.816
Victim?

00:56:03.319 --> 00:56:04.320
My dad was?

00:56:07.782 --> 00:56:08.699
What are you…

00:56:12.995 --> 00:56:14.914
My dad died in an accident.

00:56:15.956 --> 00:56:17.416
It was an accident.

00:56:19.043 --> 00:56:20.419
What do you mean he's a victim?

00:56:21.796 --> 00:56:22.880
Tell me the truth.

00:56:23.714 --> 00:56:25.007
Why is he a victim?

00:56:26.383 --> 00:56:27.426
Huh?

00:56:28.302 --> 00:56:31.472
Why is his picture up here?

00:56:32.264 --> 00:56:34.433
Say something.

00:56:34.517 --> 00:56:35.434
Come on.

00:56:36.227 --> 00:56:38.521
Tell me the truth, Yun Yi-rang!

00:56:39.021 --> 00:56:40.314
Why is he a victim?

00:57:13.722 --> 00:57:15.766
I thought you were sick
of working with us.

00:57:17.143 --> 00:57:19.562
It's kind of tough for me
after Gu-ho left.

00:57:20.688 --> 00:57:22.314
Gosh, something doesn't feel right.

00:57:22.398 --> 00:57:24.817
The true reason Kang Yo-seop hired me.

00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:28.362
She'll be more useful than I expected.

00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:31.532
So? Do you like it?

00:57:31.615 --> 00:57:33.033
I want you to come with me.

00:57:33.117 --> 00:57:34.577
You can leave if you want to.

00:57:35.119 --> 00:57:36.203
Funny.

00:57:37.413 --> 00:57:38.581
No.

00:57:39.123 --> 00:57:40.875
You got it in the end.
