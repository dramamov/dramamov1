[Episode 4]

00:00:49.267 --> 00:00:52.967
The kindergarten class is
about to start, you know?

00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:54.067
When will it end?

00:00:54.067 --> 00:00:56.100
It should take about two hours.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.367
Dong Min! Jeon Dong Min!

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:09.500
Of course.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.967
Of course, Teacher.

00:01:10.967 --> 00:01:13.133
- Principal.
- Yes.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.000
Lying itself isn't bad.

00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.833
As long as you don't get caught.

00:01:25.067 --> 00:01:27.300
Of course, Madam.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.033
Madam?

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:33.967
Principal.

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:38.400
What did you just say?

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:42.333
What, Dong Min?

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:44.367
Who is Madam?

00:01:47.267 --> 00:01:49.000
You mean Ms. Bu Se Mi?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.967
Huh? What?

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.033
Ms. Bu Se Mi?

00:01:58.067 --> 00:01:59.933
Madam?

00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:03.333
Madam, yes. Oh, my.

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:04.933
Our church's pastor's wife. Shh!

00:02:04.933 --> 00:02:06.800
I'm sorry, Madam.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.633
Oh, yes, just a moment...

00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:11.300
Dong Min, yes.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.333
Yes, I mean, exactly.

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:17.967
Yes, Madam. I'll see you on Sunday then.

00:02:17.967 --> 00:02:20.667
Yes. Amen.

00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:22.267
Okay.

00:02:23.667 --> 00:02:25.300
Ugh.

00:02:26.167 --> 00:02:29.833
Dong Min, why did you come here all of a sudden?

00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:31.733
You called my name.

00:02:31.733 --> 00:02:33.133
Don't you remember?

00:02:33.133 --> 00:02:35.467
Did I call your name?

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:37.267
Dong Min, Jeon Dong Min!

00:02:37.267 --> 00:02:38.867
Oh, my.

00:02:41.167 --> 00:02:42.867
I...

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.733
called your name.

00:02:52.733 --> 00:02:55.667
Lately, my memory's been so bad.

00:02:59.667 --> 00:03:01.167
Dong Min!

00:03:01.167 --> 00:03:03.933
It's almost time for the shuttle bus to arrive!

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:05.833
What?

00:03:05.833 --> 00:03:09.033
Wait, you called about the shuttle bus
that's always coming?

00:03:09.033 --> 00:03:11.433
Dong Min, today's a special day.

00:03:11.433 --> 00:03:13.600
Ms. Bu Se Mi's first day at work!

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.667
We need to welcome the children specially.

00:03:15.667 --> 00:03:17.433
Hurry, go out

00:03:17.433 --> 00:03:20.267
and please give them a special welcome.

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:22.933
Hurry, Mister.

00:03:22.933 --> 00:03:24.133
Sorry, Miss.

00:03:24.133 --> 00:03:25.767
Shh.

00:03:30.367 --> 00:03:32.600
Is eavesdropping your hobby?

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.100
No, I was just leaving.

00:03:47.933 --> 00:03:50.500
Admiring...

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.133
Our beloved Ms. Bu Se Mi!

00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:57.500
You're really meticulous.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.833
Then, shall we finish the conversation
we were having earlier?

00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:03.467
Let's do that.

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:07.400
Please don't make any mistakes
with titles from now on.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.467
Of course, of course!

00:04:08.467 --> 00:04:11.500
Teacher Bu Se Mi.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.433
Good.

00:04:13.433 --> 00:04:17.800
About the 300 million you promised earlier.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.400
It should be manageable
for acquiring the kindergarten.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.833
As you can see, it's rural here,
so prices aren't high.

00:04:23.833 --> 00:04:25.133
300 million?

00:04:25.133 --> 00:04:26.867
Yes.

00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:29.900
I did mention three months.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.267
Oh dear, just my share was 300 million?

00:04:35.267 --> 00:04:37.467
Don't worry.

00:04:37.467 --> 00:04:39.900
I'll settle it as soon as this job is done.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.633
Oh, you tease!

00:04:43.367 --> 00:04:46.033
Oh, you're being mischievous.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.333
A verbal contract is valid,
but for things like this,

00:04:54.333 --> 00:04:58.733
it's always more proper
to have it in writing, right?

00:04:58.733 --> 00:05:00.967
You really do seem like
Attorney Lee's older sister.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.833
I'll let the attorney know.

00:05:02.833 --> 00:05:05.633
Well, if it's about our money...

00:05:07.667 --> 00:05:12.300
Even our Lord would forgive this kind of lie.

00:05:13.133 --> 00:05:15.300
Lying itself isn't bad, you know?

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.400
As long as you don't get caught.

00:05:19.033 --> 00:05:21.300
That's quite a quote.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.433
Would you like to grab a coffee?

00:05:26.333 --> 00:05:28.900
[KE Communications]

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.067
What are they doing?

00:05:31.067 --> 00:05:33.600
Looks like there's an internet issue?

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.867
Tae Min, you notice things like that now?

00:05:38.533 --> 00:05:40.800
He's wearing a telecom company vest.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.033
Can't you see? Are you getting presbyopia already?

00:05:43.033 --> 00:05:44.800
Hey, come on!

00:05:49.033 --> 00:05:50.633
Madam.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.833
The information I'm about to share

00:05:55.833 --> 00:05:59.367
is known only to you in Muchang,
Principal Lee Mi Seon.

00:06:00.067 --> 00:06:03.833
But why are you telling me this in such detail?

00:06:03.833 --> 00:06:05.800
If anyone in Muchang

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.767
discovers I'm Kim Yeong Ran, not Bu Se Mi,

00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:11.267
and learns my personal information,

00:06:11.267 --> 00:06:14.900
it means you leaked it, Principal Lee Mi Seon.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.700
So, please keep this absolutely
confidential from now on.

00:06:27.933 --> 00:06:29.600
Then

00:06:31.033 --> 00:06:33.167
your real education...

00:06:34.133 --> 00:06:36.333
You didn't actually graduate
from Iseon Women's University, did you?

00:06:36.333 --> 00:06:38.433
No, I only finished high school.

00:06:38.433 --> 00:06:40.667
I passed the GED for middle and high school.

00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:43.867
Took the middle school equivalency test
at juvenile detention.

00:06:46.833 --> 00:06:49.400
Juvenile detention?

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.267
I stole sanitary pads.

00:06:52.267 --> 00:06:53.900
Oh, dear.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.600
You've had such misfortune.

00:06:58.267 --> 00:07:00.400
Then these family records must all be...

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.800
They're fake.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.133
I don't know who my father is.
I only have my mother.

00:07:04.133 --> 00:07:06.100
She has three criminal convictions.

00:07:08.867 --> 00:07:10.800
Oh, my. Oh, my.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.900
So your mother has a record too.

00:07:19.867 --> 00:07:24.233
It's probably easier to find what's true
than what's false, right?

00:07:24.233 --> 00:07:26.600
At least my Class-1 driver's license is real.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.067
Well, then this isn't completely fake, is it?

00:07:30.067 --> 00:07:31.867
If you want to know more about me,

00:07:31.867 --> 00:07:34.867
just search the news articles, plenty of them.

00:07:34.867 --> 00:07:39.733
But, you know the media always exaggerates.

00:07:39.733 --> 00:07:41.333
Stuff like calling you a 'gold digger',

00:07:41.333 --> 00:07:44.367
that's not all true, right?

00:07:44.367 --> 00:07:47.167
Everything except the 'gold digger' part
is basically true.

00:07:47.167 --> 00:07:51.067
Oh, so most of it's true.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.400
- Principal.
- Yes?

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.833
What should I do now?

00:07:59.833 --> 00:08:02.333
Well, then...

00:08:02.333 --> 00:08:04.267
Oh! Could you head over first?

00:08:04.267 --> 00:08:06.033
I'll follow shortly.

00:08:06.033 --> 00:08:08.333
You can leave your bag here.

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:11.167
Muchang is a safe place.

00:08:14.333 --> 00:08:16.367
By the way, Miss...

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.700
You and our Don aren't involved
in anything, right?

00:08:23.467 --> 00:08:26.833
I'm not into guys like Attorney Lee.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.900
What? Huh?

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.700
Wait, that somehow feels insulting.

00:08:39.733 --> 00:08:41.967
'Just not my type.' Pfft.

00:08:41.967 --> 00:08:43.900
Ugh, really.

00:08:53.133 --> 00:08:55.800
Cams in the classroom.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.400
But not in the hallway.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.633
What are you doing?

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.767
Aren't kindergartens required to have CCTV?

00:09:14.767 --> 00:09:16.733
Huh?

00:09:16.733 --> 00:09:19.567
Daycares are required to have it,

00:09:19.567 --> 00:09:21.867
but kindergartens aren't.

00:09:21.867 --> 00:09:24.267
You didn't know?

00:09:24.267 --> 00:09:27.600
My previous kindergarten had cameras everywhere.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.200
There's a call.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.433
- Yes.
- Installation's complete.

00:09:35.433 --> 00:09:37.200
I've sent you a link.

or laptop anytime.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.333

- Mi Seon.
- Huh?

00:10:03.333 --> 00:10:04.367
Is Ms. Bu Se Mi...

00:10:04.367 --> 00:10:07.700
She's pretty, right?
You can't take your eyes off her.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.267
Not that much.

00:10:09.267 --> 00:10:11.100
I get it, Dong Min.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.833
But don't you dare make a move. Ever.

00:10:15.833 --> 00:10:19.100
With her credentials and looks,
you think she's single?

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.867
Bet her boyfriend's loaded too.

00:10:22.867 --> 00:10:24.800
How'd you know that?

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.167
Of course. I know that.

00:10:27.167 --> 00:10:28.500
I can tell at a glance.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.600
Birds of a feather, you know?

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.833
Mi Seon, about Ms. Bu Se Mi,

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:36.533
you did properly verify her education
and background, right?

00:10:36.533 --> 00:10:40.000
I personally called Iseon Kindergarten
to confirm everything.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.500
Resumes don't show character
or compatibility, right?

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.800
What, you live in deception?

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.367
I just don't want the kids hurt.

00:10:45.367 --> 00:10:47.100
You should care more about this as principal.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.933
Then, this time, I'll pay extra attention.

00:10:49.933 --> 00:10:54.700
So stop suspecting everything, okay? Please?

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.900
Oh, hello.

Good.

- Hello.
- You're here.

00:11:22.167 --> 00:11:24.233
What brings you here?

00:11:26.467 --> 00:11:28.267
To file a missing person report.

00:11:28.267 --> 00:11:30.267
How old is the person?

00:11:30.267 --> 00:11:33.167
Any dementia or chronic illness?

00:11:34.633 --> 00:11:35.933
Twenty-nine this year?

00:11:35.933 --> 00:11:37.633
Twenty-nine...

What? Are you joking?

My father remarried.

00:11:45.633 --> 00:11:47.900
Even if you report an adult missing,

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.667
we can't search without proof of endangerment.

00:11:50.667 --> 00:11:51.933
And even if we find her,

00:11:51.933 --> 00:11:55.767
we can't disclose contact info if she refuses.

00:11:55.767 --> 00:11:59.767
So, I might never find my mother?

00:12:01.267 --> 00:12:05.967
Even when an adult is missing,
their personal decision is important.

00:12:05.967 --> 00:12:08.900
Isn't your mother more likely hiding

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.300
than missing?

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.167
Detective, you're really not understanding me.

00:12:13.167 --> 00:12:14.833
Pardon?

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.433
Yes, this is Sergeant Kim Hak Su.

00:12:18.433 --> 00:12:19.800
Yes, Team Leader.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.900
Yes, yes.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.533
What? The chief called you?

00:12:24.533 --> 00:12:27.467
Ah, yes, understood.

00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:34.433
Though she's an adult,
there's sufficient reason to believe you.

00:12:34.433 --> 00:12:36.100
We'll file a missing person report.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.233
We'll conduct a nationwide search
and investigate the disappearance.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.633
Finally, you understand.

00:12:54.433 --> 00:12:56.300
You're new here.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.167
Who introduced you?

00:12:58.167 --> 00:12:59.867
Someone named Kim So Yeong.

00:12:59.867 --> 00:13:01.700
Kim So Yeong?

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.067
That's a common name.

00:13:04.067 --> 00:13:06.567
I know at least three Kim So Yeongs myself.

00:13:06.567 --> 00:13:10.833
Short So Yeong, Tall So Yeong, Chubby So Yeong.

00:13:12.433 --> 00:13:14.000
But

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.333
the Kim So Yeong you did time with
for pyramid schemes, that one's not common, huh?

00:13:23.467 --> 00:13:25.933
You know foot baths are great, right?

00:13:25.933 --> 00:13:29.733
Raise your body temperature just one degree
and it prevents cancer and such.

00:13:29.733 --> 00:13:32.700
Add this enzyme to a foot bath

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.433
and your skin becomes smooth and silky.

00:13:37.133 --> 00:13:40.267
My mother suffered from diabetes for years.

00:13:40.267 --> 00:13:44.867
No hospital in Korea could cure it,

00:13:44.867 --> 00:13:47.367
but enzyme cured her.

00:13:47.367 --> 00:13:50.467
Then please enjoy a foot bath before you leave.

00:13:50.467 --> 00:13:52.167
How much is that?

00:13:52.167 --> 00:13:55.800
Oh, sir! You've got a good eye.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.367
I'm not the boss yet.

00:13:57.367 --> 00:14:01.867
With that shiny forehead and prominent nose,

00:14:01.867 --> 00:14:04.000
you're born to be a CEO.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.933
This bottle costs 180,000 won.

00:14:06.933 --> 00:14:09.667
Original production cost was over 300,000 won,

00:14:09.667 --> 00:14:12.200
but we deal directly with Cambodian factories,

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.133
so we offer half price.

00:14:14.133 --> 00:14:16.000
We're selling at barely 30,000 won profit,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.133
practically giving it away.

00:14:20.267 --> 00:14:22.900
Should we buy a hundred bottles?

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.567
A hundred?

00:14:24.567 --> 00:14:26.267
That many?

00:14:27.833 --> 00:14:30.333
How many installments would you like?

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.967
Forget installments.

00:14:35.967 --> 00:14:38.567
I'll buy 100 bottles

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:43.567
if you tell me where Kim So Yeong is.

00:14:58.867 --> 00:15:01.400
[18 million won]

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.033
[Kim So Yeong]

00:15:20.733 --> 00:15:22.533
You called earlier?

00:15:23.567 --> 00:15:26.167
Me? Just working like a dog, as usual.

00:15:26.167 --> 00:15:29.200
Why? What's up?

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.900
A clean-cut guy's looking for me?

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.867
I've never even dated a 'clean-cut' man.

00:15:38.733 --> 00:15:40.033
Hyeon Ok.

00:15:40.033 --> 00:15:42.000
Did you tell them where I am?

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.267
Hey.

00:15:43.267 --> 00:15:45.267
Don't you trust me?

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.700
Just warning you to be careful.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.533
Got it.

00:15:52.867 --> 00:15:54.133
What, what, what?

00:15:54.133 --> 00:15:55.700
Why don't you follow me to the toilet
while you're at it?

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.867
Oh, jeez, this.

00:15:57.867 --> 00:16:00.633
I saved yours but you disappeared.

00:16:00.633 --> 00:16:02.067
Ah, hot.

00:16:02.067 --> 00:16:04.433
Once it cools it's not as good.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.333
Anyway, if someone looks for me,
pretend you don't know me.

00:16:09.333 --> 00:16:12.667
Ugh, this place is just like jail.

00:16:12.667 --> 00:16:16.067
A mutt's on my tail,
even following me to the bathroom.

00:16:16.067 --> 00:16:18.533
I don't follow you when you poop, it smells.

00:16:18.533 --> 00:16:20.600
Whoa, jeez...

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.233
Not talking about you.

00:16:22.233 --> 00:16:25.133
Okay, talk again later.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.300
People who say 'don't you trust me'
are never trustworthy.

00:16:37.467 --> 00:16:39.433
Tasty.

00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:40.800
Nice touch.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.767
[Gaseong]

00:16:42.767 --> 00:16:46.800
I'll handle your coffee from now on.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.500
Suit yourself.

00:16:55.033 --> 00:16:57.200
Attorney, it's Byeol Nae.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.267
Someone's looking for Kim So Yeong.

00:16:59.267 --> 00:17:01.533
The caller is named Hyeon Ok.

00:17:01.533 --> 00:17:04.833
Kim So Yeong says she can't be trusted.

00:17:04.833 --> 00:17:07.267
They were prison mates,

00:17:07.267 --> 00:17:09.667
but they only have each other.

00:17:09.667 --> 00:17:11.533
Oh, Attorney,

00:17:11.533 --> 00:17:13.833
and she called me a 'mutt'.

00:17:13.833 --> 00:17:15.833
It seems Kim So Yeong

00:17:15.833 --> 00:17:19.600
doesn't realize how smart mutts are.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:24.667
Facts, opinions, and plot twists all in one.

00:17:24.667 --> 00:17:27.600
Her texts have hidden charm.

00:17:28.333 --> 00:17:30.067
Oh! You scared me.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.933
Sorry, did I startle you?

00:17:32.933 --> 00:17:35.833
I did ballet as a child,

00:17:35.833 --> 00:17:39.533
so I'm good at silent walking.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:46.133
This vacuum is really quiet too, isn't it?

00:17:49.267 --> 00:17:51.767
Of course, it's turned off.

00:17:51.767 --> 00:17:53.867
Is anyone here normal?

00:17:53.867 --> 00:17:55.033
Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:56.067
Yes?

00:17:56.067 --> 00:17:59.467
If you're done cleaning, get back to the annex.

00:18:04.167 --> 00:18:06.933
Attorney Lee, did you make my toast too?

00:18:06.933 --> 00:18:09.133
That's so touching.

00:18:09.133 --> 00:18:10.533
Shall we eat together now?

00:18:10.533 --> 00:18:12.633
I'm starving right now.

00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:15.000
I'll eat all of this myself.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.233
Oh, and,

00:18:16.233 --> 00:18:18.720
I'm going out this afternoon,

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.300
so clean every corner before then.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.567
There's too much dust in the corners.

00:18:56.833 --> 00:18:58.800
Why is it so quiet?

00:19:01.767 --> 00:19:03.800
Attorney Lee.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.067
Attorney Lee.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.333
Attorney Lee.

00:20:04.767 --> 00:20:05.900
Strawberry Class!

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.700
- Yes!
- Oh.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.333
Aren't they adorable?

00:20:10.333 --> 00:20:11.767
The kids have so much energy,

00:20:11.767 --> 00:20:15.733
so it takes time for them to calm down.

00:20:15.733 --> 00:20:17.733
Principal!

00:20:17.733 --> 00:20:19.433
Principal!

00:20:20.867 --> 00:20:25.100
Oh, please come in.
I've been waiting, just a moment.

00:20:28.633 --> 00:20:32.433
Actually, we had a meeting scheduled today
with the kindergarten supplies coordinator...

00:20:34.367 --> 00:20:35.600
Miss!

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.867
Can you watch the kids for a bit? Just briefly!

00:20:38.867 --> 00:20:40.300
Are you asking me to teach them?

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.867
It'll just be a short while, really quick!

00:20:41.867 --> 00:20:44.567
You can read them a book or teach them a song,

00:20:44.567 --> 00:20:45.900
do anything you want, anything.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.667
- Wait here.
- Principal.

00:20:58.067 --> 00:21:01.100
Hello, children.

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.300
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:07.300
I'm Ms. Bu Se Mi, starting today

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.800
with the Strawberry Class.

00:21:11.433 --> 00:21:14.067
Well, today's lesson will be...

00:21:14.067 --> 00:21:15.733
- Miss!
- Yeah?

00:21:15.733 --> 00:21:18.133
How long will you be staying here?

00:21:18.133 --> 00:21:20.667
You'll stay until Christmas, right?

00:21:20.667 --> 00:21:23.833
We'll make a Christmas tree, right?

00:21:24.567 --> 00:21:26.267
Well...

00:21:28.433 --> 00:21:29.767
That's...

00:21:29.767 --> 00:21:31.400
Ju Won, what's that?

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.433
I've never seen that before.

00:21:32.433 --> 00:21:34.833
Oh, Uncle Tae Min bought it for me.

00:21:34.833 --> 00:21:37.733
Really? Let me play with it a bit.

00:21:37.733 --> 00:21:40.033
Play with your own toy.

00:21:40.033 --> 00:21:41.933
Just let me play with it.

00:21:41.933 --> 00:21:44.200
No, play with your own.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.033
- Ah!
- Hey, that's mine.

00:21:46.033 --> 00:21:47.233
Give it back!

00:21:47.233 --> 00:21:49.367
- Kids, stop fighting.
- Fight.

00:21:49.367 --> 00:21:51.867
- Children, no fighting.
- Fight.

00:21:57.567 --> 00:21:59.500
Oh my goodness.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.800
Kids! Quiet!

00:22:14.067 --> 00:22:17.467
- Wow!
- Wow!

00:22:19.267 --> 00:22:21.167
Kids,

00:22:21.167 --> 00:22:22.800
focus!

00:22:23.667 --> 00:22:25.533
Sit down.

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:37.433
Children, have you heard of self-defense?

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:44.167
By age seven, you should know
how to protect yourselves.

00:22:44.167 --> 00:22:47.233
That's what I believe.

00:22:47.233 --> 00:22:50.267
There are 30,000 child abuse cases annually,

00:22:50.267 --> 00:22:54.233
with 38 children losing their lives.

00:22:59.333 --> 00:23:01.867
Bad people

00:23:01.867 --> 00:23:07.533
always target those weaker than them.

00:23:11.133 --> 00:23:12.200
Understood?

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.100
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:19.833
This is the most popular product
for kids these days.

00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:25.533
But nothing here really catches my eye this time.

00:23:25.533 --> 00:23:27.400
Oh dear, what a shame.

00:23:29.367 --> 00:23:30.833
Principal,

00:23:30.833 --> 00:23:35.967
I haven't met this month's quota yet,
so I'll give you a great deal.

00:23:35.967 --> 00:23:39.500
Sorry for making you come all this way.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.100
Well, our enrollment has been decreasing too,

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.667
so we can't afford to replenish supplies.

00:23:44.667 --> 00:23:48.500
We've done business for a long time,
and I'd love to help you out,

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.300
but our situation is tight too.

00:23:52.733 --> 00:23:55.667
We have a more affordable version here.

00:23:56.533 --> 00:23:58.167
Kids,

00:23:59.667 --> 00:24:01.900
this person is the villain now.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.767
That's my Dino-ping!

00:24:03.767 --> 00:24:06.033
Ping? What ping?

00:24:06.033 --> 00:24:08.267
This dinosaur is the bad guy.

00:24:09.267 --> 00:24:11.700
The villain is attacking.

00:24:13.333 --> 00:24:15.767
So what should we do first?

00:24:15.767 --> 00:24:17.300
What should we do first?

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.900
I don't know either.

00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:08.100
Whose welcome party?

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:09.767
Mine.

00:53:10.633 --> 00:53:12.667
We'd love that.

00:53:12.667 --> 00:53:15.167
This isn't just your welcome party,

00:53:15.167 --> 00:53:17.967
but it's more like neighbors
getting together for a meal.

00:53:17.967 --> 00:53:19.933
That's small-town hospitality, you know.

00:53:19.933 --> 00:53:21.433
Lovely.

00:53:21.433 --> 00:53:22.800
Where are you going, Miss?

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:23.833
To the kindergarten.

00:53:23.833 --> 00:53:25.000
But it's Saturday.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.633
Huh?

00:53:29.433 --> 00:53:30.867
This is the Women's Association President.

00:53:30.867 --> 00:53:34.567
Today at 5 PM at Mr. Jeon Dong Min's house,

00:53:34.567 --> 00:53:38.133
we're hosting a welcome party
for our new neighbor, Ms. Bu Se Mi.

00:53:38.133 --> 00:53:40.467
All residents should pause their work

00:53:40.467 --> 00:53:42.967
- and attend.
- Are we really holding the welcome dinner today?

00:53:42.967 --> 00:53:48.633
Yeah, Dong Min, we decided to hold it.

00:53:48.633 --> 00:53:50.533
Oh, my.

00:53:50.533 --> 00:53:53.333
Ms. Bu Se Mi.

00:53:53.333 --> 00:53:54.833
Madam... No, no.

00:53:54.833 --> 00:53:56.967
Ms. Bu Se Mi.

00:53:56.967 --> 00:53:59.100
A welcome party? Seriously?

00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:01.533
Don't you know this breaks the Kim Yeong Ran Act?

00:54:01.533 --> 00:54:04.200
This is a huge problem.

00:54:06.733 --> 00:54:10.400
Yes, that's why
I decided to host the dinner myself.

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:13.833
To get to know the neighbors
and build relationships.

00:54:13.833 --> 00:54:16.433
I've heard Dongwaru's food is great.

00:54:20.567 --> 00:54:24.367
- Here.
- Miss, why are you like this?

00:54:24.367 --> 00:54:27.300
Normally, as the principal,
I would handle all this...

00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:29.400
- Understood.
- No.

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.867
I'm good at things like this.

00:54:32.867 --> 00:54:35.000
I'll prepare everything perfectly.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.933
Don't worry, let go of this and answer the phone.

00:54:37.933 --> 00:54:41.267
I receive your sincerity.

00:54:41.967 --> 00:54:43.667
Alright, then.

00:54:55.467 --> 00:54:59.700
[Muchang Mart]

00:55:11.067 --> 00:55:12.733
Huh?

00:55:17.533 --> 00:55:19.167
Oh, my. He's...

00:55:19.167 --> 00:55:20.967
Hey, Jeon Dong Min! What are you doing there?

00:55:20.967 --> 00:55:23.233
Grab a shopping cart and get in here fast.

00:55:23.233 --> 00:55:26.200
Hurry up, we don't have time.
Come on, Dong Min. Ugh, seriously.

00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:27.833
Okay.

00:55:29.733 --> 00:55:31.367
Jeez.

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:39.000
Dong Min, put the snacks and dried side dishes

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.533
in there with some love.

00:55:41.533 --> 00:55:44.433
But Ms. Bu's hosting the welcome party.
Why are we doing this?

00:55:44.433 --> 00:55:46.233
Because Ms. Bu has other matters to handle.

00:55:46.233 --> 00:55:48.067
This is how we help each other in life.

00:55:48.067 --> 00:55:51.833
Why are you always so grumpy with her?

00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:55.533
Did you also get bribed by her money?

00:55:55.533 --> 00:55:57.000
To make you take her side?

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.533
No, nothing like that!

00:56:00.867 --> 00:56:02.800
This is really weird.

00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:05.067
But, why does Ms. Bu Se Mi

00:56:05.067 --> 00:56:08.400
even need to be in Muchang,
spending money to bribe people?

00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:10.533
Why did Don recommend her anyway?

00:56:10.533 --> 00:56:12.700
You're too suspicious.

00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:14.967
She just likes the countryside,

00:56:14.967 --> 00:56:17.000
wants to make friends,

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.200
and has money to spend.

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:20.700
You wouldn't understand because you don't have it.

00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:23.733
Dong Min, if you won't help me,
go stand over there.

00:56:23.733 --> 00:56:27.033
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

00:56:27.033 --> 00:56:29.700
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:30.833
I'll bring the dried side dishes.

00:56:30.833 --> 00:56:35.967
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:38.667
Hallelujah.

00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:45.600
Why's it so quiet here?

00:56:47.867 --> 00:56:49.700
Ms. Baek Hye Ji?

00:56:55.067 --> 00:56:56.700
Ms. Baek Hye...

00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:08.200
Baek Hye Ji!

is not available. Please leave a message...

What?

Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

00:57:36.167 --> 00:57:37.467
What?

00:57:37.467 --> 00:57:39.300
Where did she disappear to?

00:57:49.367 --> 00:57:51.133
Oh, no, what do I do?

00:57:51.133 --> 00:57:52.867
Hello, everyone.

00:57:52.867 --> 00:57:54.900
Thank you for your hard work.

00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:57.467
Please take care of this.

00:57:57.467 --> 00:57:59.867
- Wow, this is amazing.
- What's all this?

00:57:59.867 --> 00:58:02.600
Ms. Bu Se Mi prepared everything.

00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:05.133
She's someone who truly loves the children.

00:58:05.133 --> 00:58:08.033
We don't even have a play café here, you know.

00:58:08.033 --> 00:58:10.233
Ah, I'm honestly envious.

00:58:10.233 --> 00:58:13.333
How rich does she have to be
for a kindergarten teacher to go this far?

00:58:13.333 --> 00:58:15.533
- Unbelievable.
- Hey.

00:58:15.533 --> 00:58:19.533
Dong Min, put the makgeolli
in the farmhouse fridge.

00:58:19.533 --> 00:58:20.933
There's no space here.

00:58:20.933 --> 00:58:23.500
- Okay.
- Oh, Ju Won will love this!

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.033
Ah, he's going to love this.

00:58:25.033 --> 00:58:26.700
Please handle this well.

This is wonderful.

00:58:58.733 --> 00:59:00.367
Yes?

00:59:05.567 --> 00:59:07.433
What's that?

00:59:07.433 --> 00:59:08.633
Oh, this?

00:59:08.633 --> 00:59:10.400
Makgeolli. For the welcome party later.

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.367
Wait a second.

00:59:15.033 --> 00:59:19.100

Oh.

Right now.

I'll just put this here.

I said stay still.

Everything arrived at once.

01:00:02.867 --> 01:00:05.500
This needs to chill in the cooler.

- Is here okay?
- It's fine.

01:00:14.333 --> 01:00:18.400
Shouldn't we mix the food varieties?

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:21.200
Pair them with tasty sides.

Who are you looking for?

Is Teacher Bu Se Mi here?

but I'm very traditional.

- I'll put this down quickly.

find out I'm here?

Oh, no. Baek Hye Ji!

There are no secrets in this world, you know.

If you let dogs and pigs look down on you,
you become the dog and pig. Understand?

I might be able to find out
where our Yeong Ran is.

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:04.367
Attorney Lee, where did you hide Kim Yeong Ran?

01:04:04.367 --> 01:04:07.133
If you're in Muchang,
you have to follow Muchang's rules.

01:04:07.133 --> 01:04:08.533
- Stop it.
- Ms. Se Mi.

You may have a sharp tongue,
but I think you're actually a kind person.
