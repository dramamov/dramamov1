"Love in the Moonlight"
(Episode 7)

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:54.880
Snake!

00:01:55.563 --> 00:01:56.960
Watch out!

00:01:57.833 --> 00:02:00.040
- What is it?
- Snake!

00:02:06.257 --> 00:02:07.258
It's not a snake.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.640
It's just a rope.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.360
- I thought it was a snake.
- What snake?

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.240
You scared me.

00:02:19.763 --> 00:02:21.440
What if it bites you?

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.361
Hey!

00:04:01.857 --> 00:04:03.057
You have something to tell me?

00:04:05.523 --> 00:04:06.524
What?

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:15.971
I…

00:04:16.457 --> 00:04:18.400
- Earlier, I…
- Nope.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.921
I'm talking about your plan to help me

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.720
to avoid marrying Pin.

00:04:25.823 --> 00:04:26.824
Right.

00:04:40.277 --> 00:04:41.277
About that,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.120
I think we should hire someone to

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.290
sign a marriage certificate
with you, instead of Pin.

00:04:47.663 --> 00:04:49.360
We can make an honest deal with her

00:04:49.517 --> 00:04:51.237
that you need this to transfer your assets.

00:04:51.723 --> 00:04:52.923
This is not about love.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.920
How can we trust her

00:04:55.417 --> 00:04:56.937
that she'd transfer assets back to me?

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.320
I'm worried about that too.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.480
So I'd like to suggest Ms. Rachawadee.
We can trust her.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.200
She will be back from Penang in two days.

00:05:04.677 --> 00:05:06.320
We can ask her.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.280
My dad won't let it happen.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.320
Don't lose your hope just yet. We can talk.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.120
We should go to see Ms. Rachawadee
when we go back to Bangkok.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.680
So we can figure something out.

00:05:26.503 --> 00:05:29.000
Actually, if this is your plan

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.960
you can just wait for me to go back.

00:05:36.843 --> 00:05:37.844
You're right.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.611
But I don't know why.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.681
I wanted to see your face.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.960
What're you talking about?

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.880
We see each others almost every day.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:08.800
Have you ever heard of this poem?

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.880
The sun is shining bright during the day

00:06:15.283 --> 00:06:18.400
but without seeing your
face, it suddenly gets dark.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.680
The moon is shining bright during the night

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.280
but without seeing your face,
my heart suddenly turns black.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.041
Nonsense.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.400
What're you talking
about? Let's just go to bed.

00:06:41.063 --> 00:06:42.823
It should be boats
coming by in the morning.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.041
Sir?

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.480
What's the update? Did you see him?

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.357
We asked villagers around here

00:10:31.557 --> 00:10:32.880
and nobody saw Prince Saenkaew.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.760
Where is he?

00:10:38.203 --> 00:10:41.440
What if Kalong and Prince
Inthorn abducted him?

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.600
What're we gonna do?

00:10:44.241 --> 00:10:47.040
What? Kalong abducted Saenkaew?

00:10:49.457 --> 00:10:51.160
Is it true?

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.681
Saenkaew! You poor thing!

00:10:57.181 --> 00:11:00.343
Saenkaew! Oh my goodness!

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:03.360
- Grandma? What's going on?
- Help!

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.600
Inthorn and Kalong abducted Saenkaew.

00:11:07.897 --> 00:11:11.080
- I can barely breath!
- Grandma, let's go inside.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.160
I can't believe it.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.040
Since when was he gone?

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.537
I don't know either.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.120
I went to see him last
night and he was gone.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.000
It must be Kalong who took Saenkaew.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:41.280
I think we should go to the police.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.360
Who's out there? Prepare
a car for me, I'm going out.

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:49.900
What's going on?

00:11:50.817 --> 00:11:55.000
Saenkaew has been gone since last night.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.401
Grandma is worried that
Prince Inthorn could take him.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.321
Hurry up! We should ask the police to help.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.240
Everyone, please calm down.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.200
Prince Inthorn didn't
take Saenkaew anywhere.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.480
You know where he is?

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.520
I don't know where he is

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.000
but I'm sure that Prince
Inthorn didn't take him.

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:36.320
I saw he hopped on a
boat with Sasin last night.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.501
Sasin is here?

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:51.040
You scared me.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.680
If Saenkaew was out with
Sasin, then we don't have to worry.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.560
He must be going out like other young men.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:58.408
He'll be back soon.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.963
Sasin visits Hua Hin all the time.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.800
He knows his way around.

00:13:03.063 --> 00:13:04.764
Sasin is such a bad influence.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.100
I told him to watch the
house and he came here.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.840
I need to talk to him when I see him.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.583
- Over here!
- Help!

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.840
This way!

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.560
Help! Help us!

00:13:26.877 --> 00:13:28.120
We are here!

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.440
Over here!

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.960
- Help!
- This way!

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.790
This way!

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.121
This way!

00:13:43.783 --> 00:13:46.500
The boat is gone! What do we do now?

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.560
They must be worried about me.

00:13:50.697 --> 00:13:51.720
We can do nothing.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.800
We just need to wait for
another one to come by.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.280
- Trust me.
- You told me this last night.

00:13:57.937 --> 00:13:59.640
So many boats coming and going.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.320
Someone'd help us. See?

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.400
Do you see any boat coming for us?

00:14:08.137 --> 00:14:11.080
Should we walk to the other side?

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:13.170
I was there earlier and it's so pretty.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.680
- Perhaps there are more boats on the other side.
- Nope.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.680
Come on, let's just walk there.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.481
We can enjoy the path to calm down.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.480
- It's better than being stressed out like this.
- Hey!

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.200
How could I calm down?

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.320
My grandma has a heart condition.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.199
If she's worried about me and she got sick,
what's gonna happen?

00:14:33.223 --> 00:14:34.363
And my dad.

00:14:34.903 --> 00:14:37.640
- He must be furious that I'm gone.
- Hey.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.120
Please calm down.

00:14:40.143 --> 00:14:43.000
We still can't get out of here
even if you're so stressed out.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.320
Of course you don't have to.

00:14:45.101 --> 00:14:47.901
Nobody is waiting for you, you don't
have to be responsible for anyone.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.680
You don't have to carry the
future of your family like me.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.760
We got stuck in this place

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:54.960
it's all because of your stupid plan!

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:56.440
I'm sorry

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.800
that you got stuck with
a careless guy like me.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.160
But we have no choice.

00:15:06.517 --> 00:15:08.306
I'd rather swim in the
ocean back to the place

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.240
than being here with someone like you.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:17.271
Fine!

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.520
Just take a walk to cool thing off!

00:15:21.361 --> 00:15:22.721
I'll find something for us to eat.

00:15:56.302 --> 00:15:59.120
He's still mad? He could
be so hungry by now.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.513
I'd rather swim in the
ocean back to the place

00:16:08.537 --> 00:16:10.480
than being here with someone like you.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.640
I hope he won't do anything stupid.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:25.801
Saenkaew!

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.201
Saenkaew!

00:16:35.077 --> 00:16:36.360
Prince Saenkaew!

00:16:51.163 --> 00:16:52.164
Oh no!

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.881
Saenkaew!

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.321
Saenkaew!

00:17:04.457 --> 00:17:05.458
Saenkaew!

00:17:23.623 --> 00:17:26.480
We still can't get out of here
even if you're so stressed out.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.760
Of course you don't have to.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.800
Nobody is waiting for you.

00:17:31.283 --> 00:17:33.320
No! Saenkaew!

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.480
You don't have to be
responsible for anyone.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.201
Saenkaew!

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.080
You don't have to carry the
future of your family like me.

00:17:42.981 --> 00:17:44.120
We got stuck in this place

00:17:44.482 --> 00:17:46.520
it's all because of your stupid plan!

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.880
I'd rather swim in the
ocean back to the place

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.880
than being here with someone like you.

00:18:00.317 --> 00:18:02.440
Saenkaew! Please be all right!

00:18:03.103 --> 00:18:04.104
Saenkaew!

00:18:08.457 --> 00:18:10.137
Hey!

00:18:11.437 --> 00:18:12.438
Hey!

00:18:15.203 --> 00:18:16.363
What're you doing in the sea?

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.441
Catching some fish?

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.761
I thought you swam back.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.360
I won't do anything crazy like that.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.700
I would drown and die for nothing.

00:18:49.343 --> 00:18:51.320
I just find a place to rest

00:18:51.717 --> 00:18:53.277
so I wouldn't take it out on you again.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.080
I'm sorry for my behavior earlier.

00:19:09.001 --> 00:19:11.520
What're you doing?

00:19:14.123 --> 00:19:15.124
I'm sorry.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.521
I thought you were drowning.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.900
I was afraid that I couldn't save you.

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:24.120
You don't have to be that upsetting.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.681
I'm not crazy enough to swim back.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.100
- Hey!
- I thought I've lost you.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.720
It's just a split second
that I couldn't find you

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.241
I've never feared about
anything like this before.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.960
It made me realize

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.560
my feeling to you

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.440
and how much of it.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.040
What're you trying to say?

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:08.631
I love you,

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:10.951
Saenkaew.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:23.040
Stop making jokes already.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.200
I don't know when it started

00:20:27.263 --> 00:20:29.120
but I just feel it.

00:20:32.457 --> 00:20:34.240
I'm happy when you smile.

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:39.000
I'm in pain when you get hurt.

00:20:40.477 --> 00:20:42.640
I'm in sorrow when I don't see your face.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.760
I want to protect you, be by your side.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.583
You make me crazy like this,

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:51.770
if this isn't love, then
I don't know what it is.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.480
How do you feel about me?

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.841
It's impossible.

00:21:08.997 --> 00:21:11.560
- You don't have any feeling for me?
- Stop pushing me already!

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.840
I told you that it was impossible.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.480
It's impossible because you feel nothing,

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.560
or that we're both men

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.080
or because of society

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.360
- or because of your dad.
- All of it!

00:21:24.257 --> 00:21:25.600
How I feel about you

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.400
means nothing.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.600
Society won't accept anything like this.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.300
What about my dad?

00:21:35.057 --> 00:21:36.840
He expects me to be a leader

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.200
to take care of the family after him.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.480
But look at me.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.120
I can't even be

00:21:47.241 --> 00:21:48.600
a normal and simple man for him.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.480
Listen to me.

00:21:57.837 --> 00:21:59.600
We can't decide who to love

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.880
in this world

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.440
or how our love should be like.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.840
You have a chance to be happy

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.161
for yourself

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.080
not to carry the pride

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.320
and expectations from your dad.

00:22:20.123 --> 00:22:21.240
But my happiness

00:22:23.177 --> 00:22:24.880
and being myself hurt people.

00:22:27.083 --> 00:22:28.881
It hurts people I love.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.201
It's not true.

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:36.720
You're just being yourself.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.240
You're not hurting anyone.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:24:58.651
Sasin.

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.521
Saenkaew.

00:25:28.683 --> 00:25:29.684
I love you.

00:26:16.397 --> 00:26:17.760
Please don't worry about it.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.681
At least, we know that

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.782
Kalong didn't take him anywhere.

00:26:25.641 --> 00:26:27.400
I'd rather have Kalong taken him.

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:31.600
At least we can negotiate to get him back.

00:26:33.557 --> 00:26:34.760
But it turned out this way.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.300
Sasin is a really good man.

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.920
He was getting close to Prince Saenkaew

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.720
because he saw that the
prince was all by himself.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.300
He wanted to help out

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.720
and there's nothing more.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.440
I don't know if he'd think about anything.

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:54.973
But Saenkaew's feeling, that I know of.

00:27:04.737 --> 00:27:05.800
After he's back,

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.880
you need to watch him.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.480
Don't let him be around Sasin anymore.

00:27:57.043 --> 00:27:59.440
You haven't told me that you love me.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.601
Isn't it obvious? Do I have to?

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:14.200
You haven't told me yet.

00:28:19.677 --> 00:28:22.400
I want to hear it, can you say it?

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:27.200
Saying that this Little Rabbit

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.240
loves you so much.

00:28:34.837 --> 00:28:36.041
Goosebumps!

00:28:36.463 --> 00:28:37.760
Who'd say that?

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.360
It's fine if you don't say it now.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.640
When we're done handling
the cancellation of the wedding,

00:28:52.583 --> 00:28:54.800
I will make you say it to me every day.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.361
What's wrong?

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.601
I'm worried about Pin.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.360
She must be devastated when she found out.

00:29:25.903 --> 00:29:27.120
She must be.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.520
I did the wrong thing to her.

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:47.920
But if I let her marry you,

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.240
she will be sad and

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.640
in so much pain.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:02.921
Don't worry.

00:30:04.357 --> 00:30:05.560
I think she'll understand.

00:30:56.263 --> 00:30:57.920
This is the last clean water,

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.201
you should drink it.

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.000
You should drink it. I'm fine.

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:09.600
We don't know how long we're
gonna stay here, you should drink it.

00:31:29.977 --> 00:31:30.978
Let's share.

00:31:32.077 --> 00:31:33.560
If I need water, so do you.

00:31:36.237 --> 00:31:37.238
Here.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.300
How's the fish? Is it cooked?

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.040
Not yet.

00:31:57.761 --> 00:31:59.241
I think the fire isn't strong enough.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.000
I think there's no more left.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.120
Really? Still hot.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.481
I don't think so.

00:32:29.403 --> 00:32:31.404
What? You're teasing me?

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:32.800
No, I'm not.

00:32:33.371 --> 00:32:35.801
- Then why're you laughing?
- I'm not.

00:32:36.483 --> 00:32:38.284
You're teasing me, right?

00:32:38.377 --> 00:32:40.300
I tried to help! Watch out for the fish.

00:32:40.397 --> 00:32:42.040
- Hey!
- Come back here!

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.040
- I'm gonna grill you instead of fish!
- Don't!

00:32:44.177 --> 00:32:47.040
- No! It's hot!
- Get back down.

00:33:53.797 --> 00:33:54.957
Why do we need a coconut for?

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.080
You can drink coconut water.

00:33:57.761 --> 00:33:59.880
We can survive out of this.

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:02.191
Come here.

00:34:38.323 --> 00:34:39.324
Uncle?

00:34:40.683 --> 00:34:42.684
I'd like to apologize to you

00:34:42.803 --> 00:34:44.640
that Sasin caused some troubles.

00:34:46.383 --> 00:34:47.680
It's not your fault.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.520
It's my son's fault.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.961
He had no self-control.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.760
But you can relieve

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.240
that Sasin is there with Saenkaew.

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:03.691
I'm sure that Sasin will
take a good care of him.

00:35:07.883 --> 00:35:08.884
Sir?

00:35:09.867 --> 00:35:10.868
How is it?

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.120
A fisherman just got back and he said that

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:16.456
he took his boat passed the
abandoned island in the north.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.120
He saw smoke by the beach.

00:35:18.521 --> 00:35:21.040
It's possible that they could hide there.

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.121
Find me a boat to that island.

00:35:24.921 --> 00:35:28.120
- I'll drag him back here.
- Yes, sir.

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:50.120
Beautiful moon tonight.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.001
When I was a kid,

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.300
my mom often told me a story
about a rabbit in the moon.

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.300
It said that in the moon

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.850
there was a rabbit living in a glass house.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.600
He needed to open and close each window

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:11.920
to let moonlight shining to the earth.

00:36:13.497 --> 00:36:15.260
It's related to the moon's phases.

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.120
You're such a romantic person.

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.520
It's just like us.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.920
My name means the moon, you know?

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.101
And you're a rabbit.

00:36:38.601 --> 00:36:39.850
Rabbit belongs to the moon

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.600
just like you belong to me forever.

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:00.200
But we need to go back.

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:08.850
You don't want to go back?

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.440
We can stay here.

00:37:13.583 --> 00:37:14.920
We can do that?

00:37:17.543 --> 00:37:20.200
Sure, we can hide here.

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.680
I'll catch the fish

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:25.080
and climb coconut trees.

00:37:26.477 --> 00:37:28.600
You? Really?

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.440
You would play music all day
and I'll be starved to death.

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:34.641
Let me feed you.

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.440
You're feeding me?

00:37:38.323 --> 00:37:40.000
Right, someone like me.

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:41.641
Well, I

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:44.417
can shoot, ride horses,

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:46.680
and hunting animals, I can do it all.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.761
Fine, I trust you.

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:55.041
Then you can feeding us.

00:37:56.241 --> 00:37:58.960
And I will play music

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:03.000
and sing songs when
you're tired, sounds good?

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.481
That's it?

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:06.840
What else do you want me to do?

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.600
You're taking advantage of me.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.280
It can be just a dream.

00:38:24.177 --> 00:38:25.360
We're not like others.

00:38:34.643 --> 00:38:35.644
Hey,

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:39.480
how are we not like others?

00:38:42.483 --> 00:38:44.720
We're just two people who are in love.

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.560
You don't know my dad.

00:38:51.357 --> 00:38:52.720
He can do anything.

00:38:54.497 --> 00:38:55.800
He won't let this happen.

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:02.300
Your dad doesn't know me.

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.480
I will do anything for us to stay together.

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:15.641
Trust me.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:30.080
It's getting wet, let's
head back to the cottage.

00:40:38.303 --> 00:40:40.520
Hey! That's light from a boat!

00:40:45.817 --> 00:40:46.817
You're right!

00:40:49.117 --> 00:40:50.803
This way!

00:40:52.177 --> 00:40:54.440
We're here! This way!

00:40:58.657 --> 00:40:59.658
Help!

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:02.681
We're gonna go back.

00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:15.090
You don't want to go back?

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.240
We can stay here.

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.400
It's your call.

00:41:27.663 --> 00:41:29.440
I'm happy that I have you.

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.960
We can hide forever.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.880
And you told me

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:42.400
that you'd do anything
for us to stay together.

00:41:44.163 --> 00:41:45.164
I trust you.

00:42:05.137 --> 00:42:07.650
This way!

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:10.550
- We're here!
- Over here!

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:13.960
- Over here!
- Help!

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:18.520
- Help!
- This way!

00:42:23.523 --> 00:42:24.640
This way!

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:45.851
Dad?

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.720
- Grandma?
- Saenkaew.

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:39.480
Why did you go out without
telling anyone like this?

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:43.041
Everyone was worried about you.

00:43:43.641 --> 00:43:45.600
I'm sorry about that.

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.221
I'm sorry everyone.

00:43:49.463 --> 00:43:52.120
You two are all right, aren't you?

00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:53.700
We're fine.

00:43:56.463 --> 00:43:58.320
I'm sorry on behalf of Sasin for causing

00:43:58.390 --> 00:44:01.120
everyone to worry about Prince Saenkaew.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.201
You need to apologize to
his dad and grandma now.

00:44:17.297 --> 00:44:18.298
I'm sorry.

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.440
It's all my fault.

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:24.241
- I forced Saenkaew to run away with me…
- Stop talking.

00:44:26.783 --> 00:44:27.784
Saenkaew!

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:29.511
Let's go.

00:44:30.317 --> 00:44:31.317
I have to.

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.000
I don't want you to
misunderstand the whole thing

00:44:38.137 --> 00:44:39.200
and punish him.

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:41.280
Saenkaew didn't do anything wrong.

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.000
Sasin!

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:45.760
- You need to go back now.
- But I…

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:46.961
Go!

00:44:52.203 --> 00:44:54.880
You want Prince Kamfah
to be more furious than this?

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:57.521
Next time, when I ask you to do something

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:00.560
you need to follow my orders, you hear me?

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.001
You're so useless.

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:14.640
I'll wait in Bangkok.

00:45:43.317 --> 00:45:45.917
What did you do? You're gone for two days
and two nights with him.

00:45:49.823 --> 00:45:51.583
I went out to talk to
Sasin about something.

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:54.480
And there was a storm
so we got stuck there.

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:56.440
Your something?

00:45:57.723 --> 00:46:00.080
About canceling the wedding?

00:46:01.737 --> 00:46:03.237
Why did you even bother to ask?

00:46:03.723 --> 00:46:04.724
Saenkaew!

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:08.520
You talked back to me now?

00:46:10.737 --> 00:46:12.080
Sasin taught you, didn't he?

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:16.520
What's going on between you two?

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.201
Tell me!

00:46:26.063 --> 00:46:27.680
Did you sleep with him already?

00:46:33.423 --> 00:46:34.960
Why didn't you say something?

00:46:35.583 --> 00:46:36.584
Say something!

00:46:37.817 --> 00:46:40.880
If not, then just say no.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.760
I don't want to talk about it.

00:47:18.597 --> 00:47:19.598
Dueanpradap

00:47:23.263 --> 00:47:25.040
our son is leading to the wrong path.

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:32.520
If someone finds out about him,

00:47:36.217 --> 00:47:38.240
how could he live?

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:44.800
Everyone will turn against him.

00:47:50.877 --> 00:47:52.640
I don't want that for him.

00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:00.920
How can I save our son?

00:48:27.617 --> 00:48:31.120
It seemed like Prince
Kamfah really disliked Sasin.

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:34.920
And you're surprised?

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:38.720
Sasin is so annoying all the
time. He likes to tease people.

00:48:39.401 --> 00:48:41.000
It's not only him,

00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:43.440
I get mad just to look at his face.

00:48:46.483 --> 00:48:48.150
But I think it's not just that.

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:50.920
It must be something more.

00:49:44.417 --> 00:49:45.890
- Be careful.
- Okay.

00:49:54.003 --> 00:49:55.004
Mr. Sasin?

00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:57.311
Where're you heading to?

00:49:58.440 --> 00:49:59.520
To see Saenkaew.

00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:03.821
Did his dad punish him?

00:50:04.257 --> 00:50:05.960
He didn't do anything.

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:08.441
But I think you

00:50:08.697 --> 00:50:11.000
better stay away from him.

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:12.481
Why's that?

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:15.482
You just ran away with him.

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:18.120
I think you should wait
until things are cooling off.

00:50:18.921 --> 00:50:20.880
You should go back to your place.

00:50:23.423 --> 00:50:24.424
Please?

00:51:15.577 --> 00:51:16.578
Sasin?

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:23.801
Saenkaew?

00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:39.300
I think we should go inside.

00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:58.291
Are you okay?

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:00.880
Did your dad hit you anywhere?

00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:03.641
- Did he abuse you?
- Hey, calm down.

00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:06.031
I'm fine.

00:52:06.777 --> 00:52:07.880
My dad was furious.

00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:11.881
We shouldn't see each other for a while.

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:18.400
I will ask Ms. Rachawadee

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:21.320
about marriage certificate

00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:23.680
and to transfer your
assets as soon as possible.

00:52:24.857 --> 00:52:27.800
If it goes well, no one can stop us.

00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:32.951
Please keep me posted.

00:52:36.690 --> 00:52:37.691
I gotta go.

00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:46.011
Hey!

00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:49.351
What?

00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:52.960
I think I was clear.

00:52:54.777 --> 00:52:57.200
- If my dad finds out…
- But I missed you.

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:08.000
You don't miss me at all?

00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:23.440
Not at all.

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.201
So mean.

00:53:35.503 --> 00:53:38.800
Why do I have to fall in
love with someone mean

00:53:39.877 --> 00:53:40.878
like you?

00:55:47.003 --> 00:55:48.960
Ms. Pin, what're you doing?

00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:52.920
Can I help you?

00:55:53.043 --> 00:55:54.043
Thank you.

00:55:55.683 --> 00:55:57.280
So pretty.

00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:10.481
Do you have any idea
why Saenkaew's dad didn't like Sasin much?

00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:16.720
He didn't like it when
they hung out together.

00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:23.640
Ms. Pin,

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.201
why're you asking me that?

00:56:29.837 --> 00:56:33.280
We will get married soon

00:56:33.997 --> 00:56:35.400
when we live together

00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:39.680
I don't want Saenkaew's
dad to have beef with Sasin.

00:56:42.577 --> 00:56:45.600
I don't think you should worry about it.

00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:48.080
Don't dwell on it.

00:56:48.997 --> 00:56:52.800
When you two get married,

00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:55.481
things will get better.

00:58:12.450 --> 00:58:13.451
Sasin?

00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:21.961
Sasin?

00:58:24.583 --> 00:58:25.584
Pin?

00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:29.081
Sasin?

00:58:33.983 --> 00:58:34.984
Sasin?
