[Episode 12]

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.590
Such rash actions

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.000
harm royal dignity.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.229
This matter must be strictly investigated,

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.270
or the people will not accept it,

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.220
nor will the court officials.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.840
Actually,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.430
Prime Minister Zhuang's argument
is not without logic.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.670
You are a bit too bold.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.680
Even if you've guessed my intentions

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.050
and acted decisively,

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.230
couldn't you have

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.080
consulted with me beforehand?

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.310
Since it's all for the sake of
the kingdom,

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.870
I...

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.630
can hardly rebuke you.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.310
Mr. Ma, a reply from Jinxiu.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.170
You may go.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.700
Your Majesty,

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.800
the Emperor of Jinxiu has replied.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.550
To the Emperor of Susha,

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.030
the Prince of Zhennan
is of noble Jinxiu lineage,

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.690
with unparalleled status

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.490
and impeccable character.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.560
Your Majesty has shown great discernment,

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.000
and I shall not
let this precious gem be tarnished.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.030
The Prince of Zhennan's marriage
to your princess

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.800
will surely become a timeless tale.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.190
If we can resolve
military conflicts through this,

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.580
the princess and her husband
will have rendered great service.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.150
I will be greatly comforted.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.590
Enclosed are
Jinxiu's royal genealogy records

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.400
and the prince's birth date
as engagement gifts.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.050
May we maintain good relations

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.750
and harmony
between our families and kingdoms.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.280
Regarding the matter
of marrying into your family,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.140
I gladly give my blessing.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.620
Your Majesty, what does this mean?

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.290
Don't you understand?

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.350
Make him understand.

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.920
"Regarding the matter
of marrying into your family,

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.770
I gladly give my blessing."

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.020
Congratulations, Your Majesty,
on gaining a son-in-law!

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.550
May auspicious cranes and dragons fly
with heaven's blessing!

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.260
-Congratulations, Your Majesty!
-Congratulations, Your Majesty!

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.510
Congratulations, Your Majesty,

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.910
on gaining a son-in-law.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.960
May auspicious cranes and dragons fly

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.700
with heaven's blessing.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.420
Your Highness!

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.020
We cannot agree to this.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.180
Your Highness,

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.110
this is all Feng Suige's plot.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.170
We absolutely cannot agree to
the matrilocal marriage.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.520
How did you learn about this?

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.180
Everyone is talking about it.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.170
At the inn,

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.330
even the coachmen and servants know.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.150
The news shouldn't have spread so quickly.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.310
It must be Feng Suige

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.160
who deliberately leaked the information.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.120
He wants to publicly humiliate
His Highness

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.380
and humiliate Jinxiu.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.020
I can't stand

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.390
this humiliation anymore!

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.950
I'll pack our things and we'll leave.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:08.650
Leave?

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.480
Where to?

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.720
Back to Pingling City.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.680
If we don't leave tonight,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.410
by tomorrow, the news

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.540
will spread throughout Yujing City,

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.750
and then we'll never be able to return.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.010
It's already too late.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.260
The Emperor has already agreed.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.940
If I leave now,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.310
won't I become the one who ruins

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.900
the marriage alliance
between the kingdoms?

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.300
If Your Highness stays in Susha long-term,

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.300
the Emperor can justifiably

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.160
take back control of Pingling City.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.360
Why wouldn't he do so?

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.060
What should we do then?

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.120
Feng Suige's strategy is an open trap.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.350
There's no way to counter this.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.350
He's anticipated every situation.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.250
He knows

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.270
that Your Highness

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.070
has no choice but to stay in Susha

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.650
as a son-in-law.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:47.870
You can't agree to this, Your Highness.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.130
You absolutely can't.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.860
If we leave tonight,

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.230
what about rescuing Yixiao?

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.960
What I mean is

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.159
we should leave with Yixiao together.

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.770
Enough.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.650
Things have come to this point.
We can't fight fate.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.200
This marriage
was bound to happen eventually.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.170
Moreover, our marriage

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.440
is greatly important to Jinxiu.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.980
Becoming a son-in-law
doesn't just humiliate me.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.180
It also affects the Emperor's dignity.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.160
I'll keep this in mind.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.730
He'll pay for it later.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.540
Your Highness,

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.430
what if we let Feng Suige believe

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.080
that we're leaving

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.270
Yujing tonight?

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.190
Why are you bringing him up?

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.590
He must be secretly celebrating right now.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.260
If I were Feng Suige,

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.750
I would keep Yixiao under house arrest.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:37.530
Because if someday

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:38.800
we decided to go down fighting

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.810
and leave Yujing,

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.900
we might take Yixiao with us.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.050
Yixiao staying at Zhengnian Hall

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.310
is ultimately unsafe.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:47.070
She could fall into

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.130
Feng Suige's hands again at any time.

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:50.750
Here.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.050
You two,

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.260
go to Zhengnian Hall now
and stay with her.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.500
The current situation is sensitive.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.580
I must stay here

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.510
to avoid giving others grounds
for criticism in the future.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:00.270
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.690
(Rice Cake)

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:21.330
Your Highness.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:22.830
All the people around have left?

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:23.390
Yes.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.870
The enemies won't be alerted.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:25.870
But Your Highness,

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:26.950
how can you be certain

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:27.430
that Xia Jingshi

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:28.850
will definitely act tonight?

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:29.920
[Inn]

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.360
Jinxiu's messenger
just entered the city today

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.680
and Xia Jingshi has already left
the pharmacy

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.010
and returned to the inn.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.720
I believe he already knows about

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.600
the reply from the Emperor of Jinxiu.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.580
With his power alone,

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.310
he can't change the situation.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.920
If he wants to escape from Susha,

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.580
he must have someone help him.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.980
And he will definitely come
to find him personally.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.800
[Zhengnian Hall]

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.480
Xueying,

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:27.810
there's sleeping gas!

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.150
Sister!

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.150
Protect the children!

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:45.680
Alright.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.010
Yixiao!

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.440
Sister, the children are all safe.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.630
After him!

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:32.390
Sir.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.130
Please come in.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.120
Who exactly

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.510
is Xia Jingshi meeting?

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.040
In my opinion,

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.100
it's most likely Prime Minister Zhuang.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.390
Before today,

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:52.840
I also thought

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.240
this person would be
Prime Minister Zhuang.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:54.750
But Fu Yixiao

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.220
gave me a new idea.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.790
After the Battle of Pingling, this person

00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:59.720
disguised as a merchant

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.870
and sneaked into Jinxiu's military camp

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:02.270
to meet secretly with Xia Jingshi.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.150
Then it couldn't possibly be
Prime Minister Zhuang

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.440
but someone else.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.270
We can't worry about all that now.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:08.240
We must find this person

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:08.840
today.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:09.730
Your Highness!

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:14.720
There's trouble at the pharmacy.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.510
The pharmacy is in trouble,

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:16.270
yet you have time to come here?

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.320
Why aren't you helping?

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.380
I told Gu Yu to come

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:19.840
and report everything
to His Highness first.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.440
Lu Ke,

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.490
keep watching Xia Jingshi.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:23.060
Yun Fang,

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.200
send men to surround the teahouse.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.380
Gu Yu, come with me.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:27.320
Let's go.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:37.810
Split up and chase him!

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.100
Go help Yixiao!

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:39.790
You be careful.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:40.240
Hurry!

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.320
Who are you?

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.000
Why do you want to kill Yixiao?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Seems I won't be able to leave today.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:03.390
Why would someone

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.320
in Yujing City want to harm you?

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.010
How would I know?

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:05.870
Are you hiding something

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:06.770
from us?

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.130
It's you all
who are hiding things from me.

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:13.450
Explain yourself.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.440
What have we hidden from you?

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.500
You know very well.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.960
I won't argue with you today.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.400
Let's chase the assassin first.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.020
Yixiao!

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.150
Why?

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:50.700
Yixiao,

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:52.470
I'm sorry.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.590
Why are you doing this to me?

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:56.840
We are

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.300
brothers who faced
life and death together!

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.120
Yixiao,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:02.930
I have no choice.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:04.440
For Jinxiu,

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:06.240
I have no choice!

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:08.990
I've suspected anyone.

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:11.240
How could it possibly be you?

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.020
Why are you doing this to me?

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.850
Why would you do this?

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.230
Our lives

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.620
have long ceased to belong to ourselves.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:23.480
Yixiao.

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:25.440
You go ahead.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.410
When I finish what I need to do,

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.400
I'll join you in the afterlife.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.040
What I owe you,

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.260
I'll repay in the next life.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:51.340
Take this.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.360
What is this?

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.700
This is my mercy as a prince.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.460
So you were prepared all along.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:15.460
I was right.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.150
You've already remembered

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:18.350
who wants to kill you.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.270
Xia Jingshi shot me down with an arrow,

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.120
simply because I heard

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.200
what I shouldn't have heard.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:26.840
What exactly happened

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.910
in that tent that day?

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:29.390
And who was that so-called merchant?

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.030
What are you really planning?

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.230
All you need to know is

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:33.980
everything is for Jinxiu!

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:34.890
Am I not

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:35.880
a citizen of Jinxiu too?

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.080
Am I not your brother?

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:37.890
Would I really

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:39.440
betray Jinxiu?

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:40.670
I've risked my life

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.210
for Jinxiu all these years.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.680
What plan could possibly

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.360
make you so determined to kill me?

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.490
Stop asking!

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.160
Everything I've done

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:39.910
was for Jinxiu,

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:41.870
for His Highness!

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:16.950
I, Ning Fei...

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:18.420
I, Fu Yixiao...

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:19.780
I, Xiao Weiran...

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.640
With tea in place of wine,

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:23.760
hereby become sworn brothers.

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:30.750
We may not have been born
on the same day...

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.620
But we vow to die on the same day.

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:26.350
Go!

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.200
She told you to go.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.120
Did I say you could leave?

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:12.590
You know

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.240
I never agreed to this marriage alliance.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.300
Jinxiu Military Advisor Xiao Weiran

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:18.330
deliberately attempted to harm my family.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:19.560
I can't let

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.570
such a good opportunity slip away.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:23.270
Will you surrender

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:24.760
or fight to the death?

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.480
Your choice.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:42.870
Come, this way please.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:46.030
Where's the customer

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:47.350
who just went upstairs?

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:48.210
He's upstairs.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:51.750
Hey.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:19.780
Hurry!

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.600
Where is he?

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.350
Speak up! Where is he?

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.070
Speak? He escaped through the back door.

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.780
Where is he?

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.540
[Hongfu Pewterware]

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.580
Your Highness,

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.590
please punish me.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:40.640
I lost him.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:47.940
Your Highness,

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:48.790
when I went in,

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:49.640
I saw Xia Jingshi

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.590
going upstairs.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.660
He couldn't have done this alone.

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:13.960
He must have had help.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.650
Do you mean

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:17.360
someone helped him escape?

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:19.680
Otherwise, how would a prince from Jinxiu

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.290
know which teahouse
in Susha's Yujing Capital

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:22.760
has a back door?

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.270
Your Highness, don't worry.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:25.200
I'll lead men to search right away.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.090
We'll definitely catch him.

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:26.960
No need to search.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.580
Before you even begin,

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.000
he probably will have already

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.590
returned to the inn unscathed.

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:32.110
However, tonight

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:33.840
wasn't completely fruitless.

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:36.440
Just now, Xiao Weiran
tried to kill Fu Yixiao.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.270
The fox has shown its tail.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:39.980
Go interrogate him

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.820
and deliver a message from me.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.510
Yes.

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:11.200
Being so cautious,

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:14.270
seems like you're afraid of Feng Suige.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:16.710
Shouldn't you be

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.530
the one being cautious?

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:22.010
I can't stay in Susha anymore.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.320
I must go back.

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:25.830
After the wedding,

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:26.900
I'll find a way

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.300
to help you leave Yujing.

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:29.270
However,

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.780
what do you plan to do with that woman?

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:34.900
She's lost her memory.

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:36.510
She won't be a threat.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.300
Who can be certain about that?

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.510
There's no guarantee

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.240
she won't remember something.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.660
I've already killed her once.

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.720
I will never

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.020
kill her again.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.860
I'll bring her back to Jinxiu.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:49.640
Also,

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:51.680
after your plan starts,

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.640
the secret will no longer be a secret.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.240
Anyway,

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.400
she can't die.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:58.970
Your Highness,

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.130
are you certain?

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:02.580
What do you mean?

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:05.940
Xiao Weiran
failed to assassinate Fu Yixiao.

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:07.400
He has now fallen

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.800
into Feng Suige's hands.

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:10.130
Let me remind you.

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:12.590
If you don't want to be
trapped here forever,

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:13.960
stay calm

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.400
and don't act rashly.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.460
Don't sacrifice yourself

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:19.490

I captured him.

Thank you for your good intentions.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.300
But your way of comforting people

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:31.700
is truly terrible.

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:57.030

You even bear to kill your own.

Tell me,

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.510
if a human truly becomes
heartless and disloyal,

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:35.710
how are they any different from beasts?

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.800
The prince will punish me

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.070
for what I've done.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:42.920
The marriage alliance
between our kingdoms is imminent.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.520
The prince will soon find out

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.760
that you've imprisoned me here.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.280
Aren't you all

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.880
afraid of ruining the bigger picture?

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:55.130
Your life or death
won't affect the bigger picture.

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:57.750
Jinxiu's undercover guards

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.680
infiltrated Susha's Yujing City,

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.240
hijacked and burned a merchant ship,

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.700
and attempted to assassinate His Highness.

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:06.680
We haven't

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.680
even settled this debt with you yet.

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:13.550
In such a short time,

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:15.720
you managed to get an entire ship of oil.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.790
There must be someone

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:18.850
in Yujing City secretly helping you.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.640
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.400
It doesn't matter if you don't confess.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.700
We have plenty of time.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.950
Don't expect to

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:30.810
get a single word out of me.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.600
We know you're tough.

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:33.890
His Highness said,

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:34.860
for you,

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.270
it's imprisonment without trial,

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:38.880
confinement without execution.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.010
What does that mean?

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.880
What exactly do you mean?

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.000
Did you say what I told you to?

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.870
How did he react?

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:54.400
It seems the ship burning incident

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.200
is definitely connected to him.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.500
That's right.

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:00.620
Besides Xia Jingshi,

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.720
only he can mobilize
Jinxiu's undercover guards.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.580
Your Highness,

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.240
the marriage alliance
is about to take place.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.510
Now that we've captured Xiao Weiran,

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:07.310
won't Xia Jingshi

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:07.960
make a fuss

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:08.860
with this?

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.240
Making a fuss
will only hinder the marriage alliance,

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.920
which isn't what he wants to see.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.050
Then isn't he afraid

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.750
Xiao Weiran might be forced to confess?

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:17.750
He knows Xiao Weiran won't confess.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:20.370
And we don't need his confession anyway.

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:22.110
Then I'm even more confused.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:23.200
Your Highness, you clearly know

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.250
he won't say anything,

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:26.450
yet you still keep him imprisoned here.

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:27.880
Do you want to

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:30.110
force him to commit suicide?

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:32.110
Just because we can't get him to talk

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:34.240
doesn't mean others can't.

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.010
Why are you doing this to me?

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:03.550
We are

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:05.790
brothers who faced
life and death together!

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:06.720
I, Xiao Weiran...

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.550
I, Fu Yixiao...

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:08.350
I, Ning Fei...

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:10.480
From this day on, join the Zhennan Army

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:12.680
and swear loyalty unto death
to His Highness!

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.720
Kill!

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.260
[Wutong Mansion]

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.240
Feng Suige!

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.250
Where is Yixiao? Where is she?

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.480
She's safe.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:04.790
What about Weiran?

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:06.050
Is he here with you too?

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:08.330
He plotted to kill Yixiao,

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.310
so I locked him up.

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:10.590
Stop talking nonsense.

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:11.880
I don't care what tricks you're playing.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:12.880
You must hand them

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:13.810
over to me today.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.090
Otherwise, I'll...

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:18.240
Otherwise what?

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.440
I see that besides talking big,

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.040
you only have brute strength

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:24.830
and no other use.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.880
No wonder even your own brother

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.670
manipulates you.

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:29.960
What are you saying?

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:36.810
You should recognize

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:38.710
this waist token, right?

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.200
How did you get this?

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:44.310
This was found on

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:46.110
an assassin's body in the forest

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:48.040
where Fu Yixiao fell off the cliff.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:51.880
Assassin?

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.880
After Fu Yixiao fell off the cliff,

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.110
she was attacked by assassins.

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:57.020
You didn't know?

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:58.170
You're lying.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.720
Yixiao fell off the cliff by accident.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:00.870
Who told you that?

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:02.550
Someone saw it with their own eyes

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:03.680
that His Highness and Weiran...

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:04.750
Why should I tell you?

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:07.550
With her skills,
how could she accidentally fall?

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.100
Perhaps she had too much to drink.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.020
I think Xia Jingshi

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.350
keeps you around

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:14.400
for entertainment.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:14.980
Hey!

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:16.930
The wound on Fu Yixiao's shoulder

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.480
was from an arrow shot within five steps

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.240
of her.

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.520
She was completely unprepared,

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.440
which means the archer

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.790
was someone she trusted.

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:23.830
Later, I found her

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:24.350
at Zhengnian Villa

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:25.880
and brought her back to Yujing.

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.200
Along the way, Jinxiu's undercover guards

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.480
were waiting for an opportunity,

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.350
and they knew

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:31.000
they couldn't make a move in Yujing City.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.400
That's why they used those children

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.210
to force her to show herself.

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:37.510
Haven't you thought about any of this?

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:39.790
This...

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.730
And who can mobilize

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:45.160
these Jinxiu underover guards?

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.260
I don't need to tell you this.

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:48.060
You should already know, right?

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:55.140
Feng Suige,

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.500
don't think that I'll believe you

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:57.490
by playing these tricks.

00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:59.620
If you don't believe me, go ask Yixiao.

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.480
I will.

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:04.820
Yixiao!

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:06.930
Yixiao!

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:10.480
Yixiao, answer me!

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:12.960
Yixiao, where are you?

sow discord between us.

allowing the Prince of Zhennan
to stay in Susha

I have instructed
the Ministry of Rites to set a date.

What's wrong?

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.510
Your wedding is approaching,

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:13.310
yet you still think of seeing me?

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:15.070
Brother,

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.210
are you reproaching me?

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:19.930
I was just making a casual remark.

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:21.550
Can't I even make

Why are you so down?

I don't know

if I should tell you or not.

what can't you tell me?

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:41.960
Since you've agreed

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.710
for me to marry the Prince of Zhennan,

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:45.150
I feel grateful.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.800
I shouldn't be the one to say this.

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.480
I can't say it either,

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:50.400
but still,

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.510
I can't help wanting to know the truth.

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:53.310
Brother, why are you doing this?

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:54.360
Are you referring to

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.220
making him marry into our family?

00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:00.060
He can stay with his family

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:01.860
and marry the person he loves.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.550
Isn't that the best outcome?

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:04.360
But after all,

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.230
he is the Prince of Zhennan from Jinxiu.

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.960
This marriage alliance

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.220
is not only a matter between our kingdoms

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.710
but also a blessed union
between him and me.

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:13.110
I thought that in the days to come,

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:13.800
I could be with him

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.480

I never imagined

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.690
he would be trapped in a cage
because of me.

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:23.670
What do you want then?

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.380

He was acting on someone's orders.

00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:59.210
Years ago, the Xun family

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:01.000
received favors from Empress Zhuang.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.440
This matter is likely connected

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.640
to the Zhuang family.

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:06.450
So the Empress sent someone

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:07.760
to kill Miss Yixiao?

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.530
For Prime Minister Zhuang?

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:14.030
Prime Minister Zhuang
instructed the Empress to do this?

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:15.880
For now, we don't need to
ask so many questions.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:18.360
Once we catch Xun Xiang,
everything will be clear.

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.360
We need him alive.

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:20.400
Understood.

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:27.510
The marriage alliance
is already finalized.

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:29.840
Why did you take such unnecessary action?

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:32.360
I'm just removing obstacles

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:33.690
for Xiyang, that's all.

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:35.760
That female general from Jinxiu

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.670
went through life and death
with Xia Jingshi.

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:39.710
They've probably already
fallen for each other.

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:41.380
She's just a female general.

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:43.440
Are you saying Xia Jingshi

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.500
won't have concubines in the future?

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:48.390
But in my opinion,

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:49.710
if that woman isn't eliminated,

00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:51.590
she'll eventually become a threat.

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:53.320
She's in Yujing City right now.

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:54.630
How could I miss

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:55.710
this opportunity?

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:57.070
You acted rashly.

00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:59.030
If Feng Suige notices anything,

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.110
the blame will fall on me.

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.510
Father, you needn't worry.

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:04.510
That Xun Xiang

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:06.320
comes from the 17th Battalion
of lower ranks.

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.310
Nobody pays any attention to him.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:09.730
He won't be connected

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:11.030
to you in any way.

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:12.230
Anything you do

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:13.560
will be connected to me.

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.580
Drop this matter.

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:17.480
Don't act rashly again.

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:31.580
Let me remind you.

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:34.320
If you don't want to be
trapped here forever,

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:35.630
then stay calm

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.230
and don't act rashly.

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:47.410
Your Highness,

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:49.070
Princess Xiyang is here.

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.920
Got it.
