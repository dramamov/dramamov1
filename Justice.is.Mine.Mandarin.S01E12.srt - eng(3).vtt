00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.160
To avoid a repeat of the Ma Shan Bao incident,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.200
solitary confinement and news blackout...

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.599
are necessary measures...

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.080
to ensure Qin Yi Wei's safety.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.680
This approach will only keep things hidden for a short while.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.199
Once this case goes to court,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.200
it will be exposed.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.720
Then,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.879
Han Kui Long will find out...

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.319
that the one who almost killed his son...

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.480
is Qin Yi Wei.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.640
I suggest that from now on,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.080
everyone cancels their leave.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.160
For 24 hours,

00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:28.279
make sure someone keeps an eye on Han Lie...

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.280
and Qi Chang Rong.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.760
Why keep an eye on Qi Chang Rong?

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.280
People like Qi Chang Rong...

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.840
love to fish in troubled waters.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.240
He only wants chaos.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.040
Judge Qin, you can talk in private.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.480
Call me when you're done.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.720
Okay, thank you.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.640
Yi Wei.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.960
Are you alright?

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.040
Not really.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.840
But I'm hanging in there.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.800
Dad.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.080
Don't fight with Grandma anymore.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.440
She's also very upset...

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.920
that I ended up like this.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Grandma gave it to me.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.920
I couldn't find it.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.360
So it was with you.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.680
Yi Wei.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.440
Don't be afraid.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.520
First, this is your first offense.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.560
You turned yourself in.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.560
Besides, it was an accident.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.320
The judge won't give you a heavy sentence.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.200
Dad.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.560
It wasn't an accident.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.840
What did you say?

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.320
I intentionally hit that scumbag.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.360
Intentionally?

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.920
I did it for my mom.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.480
Mom?

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.120
I knew why Mom killed herself.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
(Justice Is Mine)

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.000
(Episode 12)

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.560
Dad.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.919
Back then, you were either in court...

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.000
or in meetings every day.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.160
You never had time to be at home.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.280
But Mom said it was okay.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.520
Because she knew what your dream was.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.240
Just because you sentenced Han Kui Long to prison,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.240
that scumbag raped Mom!

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.560
Don't be nervous!

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.040
It's okay.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.080
It's okay.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.360
Scream louder!

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.360
Look at me.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.240
My name is Han Gang.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.880
My dad's name is Han Kui Long.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.480
Remember that.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.720
Tell your husband about it.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.960
Remember me.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.160
Call me whenever you want to have fun.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.240
Bye.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.640
I will never forget...

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.440
that scumbag's face.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.560
It's okay.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.400
It's okay.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.640
I'm okay.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.040
She didn't want me to call the police.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.120
She didn't want to affect you.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.240
So she didn't want anyone to know.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.240
But the next day,

00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:46.439
she couldn't get over it.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.600
She killed herself.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.880
I was so angry.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.760
I hated myself so much.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.840
One day, I saw him on the street.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.200
He was wearing Mom's necklace.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.240
I immediately followed him in your car.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.720
I wanted him dead!

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.360
I want revenge!

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.200
(Beloved Wife)

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.440
Honey.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.800
You tie my tie for me every day.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.439
I feel like it's my...

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.720
most glorious moment.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.680
You really can't turn it down this time?

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.720
The presiding judge suddenly fell ill.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.040
If I don't take over,

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.320
the case will be postponed.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.720
Then the defense...

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.720
will have further objections.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.920
I can't turn it down.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.840
But the gang of Han's...

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.520
has a lot of clout.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.880
I know what you're worried about.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.880
I can't back down because I'm scared.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.080
I also have to tell everyone...

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.760
that nothing is above the law.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.720
How's it? Is it done?

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.640
Dad, catch!

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.360
It's my turn now.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.720
Dinner's ready.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.120
Honey.

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.040
Sit down.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.080
Dad,

00:08:46.081 --> 00:08:47.440
next week when we go to the game,

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.200
we'll both wear blue.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.640
Mum will wear red.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.680
Wei Wei,

00:08:53.681 --> 00:08:54.879
do you know that your dad...

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.720
is presiding over a very important case?

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.160
Here we go again.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.880
When will Dad stop presiding over cases?

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.320
It's like this.

00:09:02.321 --> 00:09:04.240
Because this case is quite complicated.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.840
I'm going to judge a gang leader,

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.839
so it will take a long time.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.439
The relationships of those involved are complex.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.679
So this trip of ours will be...

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.680
Dad.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.160
You're a judge.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.920
Yet you often break your promises.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.040
Watching the game was your idea.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.720
What do you mean?

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.880
Besides court cases,

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.600
neither Mom nor I matter?

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.480
Why don't we wait for them to come next time?

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.359
Or we'll just have to wait until your dad takes off work...

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.360
and we'll go abroad.

00:09:28.361 --> 00:09:29.520
We can fly over to watch the game.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.920
Go by yourself.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.840
Wei Wei.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.840
Ignore him.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.280
The most important thing is,

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.400
do you also think that way?

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.800
I'm not a kid.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.320
Don't worry. I'll just coax him, and he'll be fine.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.999
After I'm done with this case, I'll apply for a long leave.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.160
We'll go on a family trip.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.440
Let's have a sweet vacation.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.880
Sure.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.920
Let's go camping.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.120
Wei Wei likes it.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:54.920
Let's eat first.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:05.880
Honey.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.960
What's wrong with you, honey?

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.360
Honey.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.999
Why are you so cold?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.680
Honey, why are you so cold?

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.440
Why are you so cold?

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.320
What's wrong?

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.480
- What's wrong? - Mom.

00:10:17.481 --> 00:10:18.920
Why are you so cold?

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.360
Yi Wei, bring me the blanket.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.840
Your mom is cold. Hurry up.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.160
Hurry up.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.600
Bring me the blanket!

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.040
Hold her.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.080
Hold your mom.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.680
Honey.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.080
You're so cold. Your mom is so cold.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.480
Honey.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:36.960
Honey.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
No, honey.

00:10:38.001 --> 00:10:39.280
Honey, no. No!

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.400
No, honey!

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.400
The person who hit my brother has been arrested.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.560
His name is Qin Yi Wei.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.080
He's the son of a judge.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.560
However,

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.160
the police have sealed the information.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.080
We don't know where he is being held.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.080
The detention room at the Eastern District Police Station.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.600
Dad, you're in prison, yet you're so well-informed.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.600
As long as there are people...

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.040
and money,

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.280
what information can't you buy?

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.880
When the court sentences him to prison,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.200
I guarantee he won't live to see the day he gets out.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.920
I'm the only one who can judge...

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.240
who harmed my son.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.480
I want to sentence him to death.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.720
Okay.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.600
I'll make the arrangements.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.360
How is your brother recovering?

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.360
He's doing well.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.320
Yesterday, he even asked me if I could...

00:13:58.680 --> 00:13:59.960
arrange two girls to serve him.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.400
I think he'll recover soon.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.840
Xiao Lie,

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.240
you can do it.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:16.600
Our Han family...

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.400
will depend on you two brothers.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.280
I got it, Dad.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.520
Get in!

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.200
Squat down.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.240
Squat down! Don't move!

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.800
I'll leave them to you.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.120
- They're all hooligans. - Okay.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.200
Sit properly. What kind of attitude is that?

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.480
Shouldn't you be more polite? Sit properly.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.640
Who's your boss?

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:40.800
It's none of your business.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
What's going on here?

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.320
Officer, what are you doing?

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.440
Why did you arrest me?

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.920
You resisted arrest,

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.240
assaulted an officer,

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.919
and possessed an offensive weapon.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:49.960
That's why I arrested you, alright?

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.080
Sit tight.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.400
Or I'll charge you with obstruction of justice.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.240
Hello. Yes.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.360
Got it.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.440
I'll bring it over after taking statements.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.680
Okay.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.120
My hand is about to break.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.599
You never change.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.679
How dare you steal in the police station?

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.680
Watch out.

00:15:03.681 --> 00:15:04.960
Luckily, he didn't steal your gun.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.160
Okay, thank you.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.440
Officer Hu.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.199
Do you know how chaotic it is out there?

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.360
It's all premeditated.

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.560
Someone is indeed declaring war on us.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.880
Their target is Qin Yi Wei.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.080
All the suspects we just arrested can't stay here.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.999
I've requested backup...

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
from the West District Police Station...

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.600
to take in the suspects over here.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.200
The higher-ups have also approved it.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.440
He said if there are too many of them,

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.640
they can be transferred to the prison...

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.360
for temporary detention.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.200
This is a tough battle.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.480
We can't let them succeed.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.560
Boss.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.480
It's quite bouncy.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:17.680
Be careful.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.920
You're faster than me.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.000
- Alright. - Go back.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.400
Be careful.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.160
- Slowly. - Be careful.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.440
Take your medicine.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.480
I'll give you half an hour to take a shower.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.440
- Young Master Gang. - What's wrong with you?

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.960
Young Master Gang, are you all right?

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.160
Go away!

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.320
Back off!

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:01.640
Go!

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.120
Young Master Gang, this is a hospital.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.280
Yes, this is a hospital.

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.920
Hey, how about this?

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.280
Arrange a girl for me.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.720
She can pretend to be a nurse.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:19.880
Young Master Lie wanted to see me.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.280
Hey, take care of Xiao Lie.

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.120
It's okay. Take them away.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.520
Just leave. Stop dawdling.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.160
Hey, Luo Qiang.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.520
I want two girls.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.200
Yi Wei.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.080
You're my son.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.920
I won't abandon you.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.960
No matter what happens.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.880
Understand?

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.040
Let go!

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:31.880
Congratulations.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.080
This move is your way to lure the snake out, isn't it?

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:35.880
Wait.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.280
Come on, share it with me.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:44.680
It's simple.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.200
Since they can't send outsiders in,

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.320
they can only use...

00:19:48.321 --> 00:19:50.160
someone already locked up in here to do the job.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:51.840
I've checked.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.599
There were two detainees already held here...

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.040
awaiting court appearances.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.200
It's most likely them.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.240
Because they're both Han Kui Long's men.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.319
And among these two,

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.519
one of them made a phone call...

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.520
after Qin Yi Wei went inside,

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.200
then told our staff that he had a stomachache,

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.280
and had to go to the bathroom.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.200
I just went with the flow,

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.520
and let him go to the bathroom.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.159
That means you let Qin Yi Wei go in,

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.160
then forced him to make a move.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.560
That's right.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.600
Amazing.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.359
Until Qin Yi Wei is safely brought to court,

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.839
our mission remains unfinished.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.360
That's why I would say...

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.240
it still depends on your hard work going forward.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.160
I'll get back to work, Officer Hu.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.520
Wait a minute.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.120
One last question. I really have a doubt I'd like to ask you.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.439
Was that criminal really having stomach pain,

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.480
or was he faking it?

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.040
Go to the toilet and see for yourself.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.040
Young Master Lie.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.039
The settlement money for the fellows arrested today...

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.040
has already been distributed.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:20:59.600
What about Li's share?

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.039
He was sentenced to life for murder.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.040
Besides the money,

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.960
we also gave his family a house.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.080
It's worth it for Qin Yi Wei's life.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.200
Hello.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:21.840
Young Master Lie.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.280
Li messed up.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.280
It's just a matter of time.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.000
Once he's in prison,

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.080
I'll play with him slowly.

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.120
Madam, this area has been cleared.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.200
Dad.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.440
- Wei Wei. - Grandma.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.520
Inspector Tang.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.000
Yesterday, Yi Wei told me on the phone...

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.840
that someone really wants to kill him in there.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.360
While he's in custody,

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.000
we've ensured the suspect's safety.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.480
Now, we've safely brought him to court.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.039
As for the suspect you mentioned,

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.240
he'll be dealt with according to law.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.880
We shouldn't need to report...

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.480
the details to you, Judge Qin.

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.800
If something happens to him in there, who's responsible?

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.720
Why did your son end up going to prison?

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.520
Whose responsibility is it, after all?

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.800
Perhaps you should think about it.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.040
Turning yourself in...

00:23:12.041 --> 00:23:13.119
is an act of remorse...

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.800
and willingness to take responsibility.

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.799
Judges may reduce sentences at their discretion...

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.840
as encouragement.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.519
Plus, with all the letters of plea...

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.280
written by your professors and classmates at university,

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.960
the sentence should be about a year.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.359
If you behave yourself,

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.920
you'll be out in no time.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.440
Your Honor,

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:42.960
the defendant, Qin Yi Wei,

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.160
fled after the car accident,

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.400
with no regard for the victim's life.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.760
The prosecution hereby requests Your Honor...

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.519
to rule that the defendant is guilty...

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.720
of one count of evading responsibility...

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.920
...under the Road Traffic Act.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.600
Besides, please impose a sentence commensurate...

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.080
with the actual harm he caused.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.479
Defense, what is your response...

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.560
to the prosecution's statement?

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.480
Your Honor.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.240
First of all,

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:14.880
on behalf of my client,

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.240
I would like to sincerely apologize...

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.840
to the injured in the accident.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.839
The accident occurred...

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.000
due to a collision between two cars.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.559
My client,

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.160
in extreme panic,

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.000
suffered an asthma attack.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.080
So he made the wrong choice.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.760
He regretted it a lot after the accident...

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.800
and he was sad every day.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.640
He could no longer bear the pangs of his conscience...

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.960
and turned himself in to the police,

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.600
hoping to make amends for all his wrongdoings...

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.480
and take responsibility for his actions.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.160
The defendant's attitude of pleading guilty...

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.520
and his act of turning himself in are commendable.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.800
But I must remind the defendant...

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.520
that evading responsibility...

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:58.000
has caused irreparable harm to the victim.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:24:59.800
Your Honor.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.280
Half a year ago,

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.040
my client's mother...

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.200
took her own life unexpectedly.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.120
For a teenager,

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.880
this is a very heavy blow.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.680
According to the psychological report,

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:17.240
my client is prone to depression and cognitive bias.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.080
This led him to make an incorrect judgment during the incident.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.520
My client's father...

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.080
is also a senior judge.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.080
He abides by the rule of law...

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.440
and upholds justice.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000
However,

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.999
he has sacrificed the care and companionship...

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.240
he could have given his son.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.600
This resulted in a lack of fatherly love...

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.040
during his upbringing.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.400
And when he lost his mother,

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.280
he felt isolated and helpless.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.200
The defendant in the dock...

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.440
is a university student without criminal record.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.840
He deeply regrets his actions...

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.280
and hopes to atone for his mistakes.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.440
Fifty professors and students...

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.680
from his university wrote letters of plea.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.719
We hope the court...

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.320
will give him a chance to reform.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.680
We also hope, Your Honor,

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.440
that you will take these factors...

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.200
into consideration for sentencing.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.240
Thank you.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.240
Hit-and-run after a car accident...

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.280
is a serious crime.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.800
Imprisonment must be imposed...

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.720
to serve as a deterrent.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.600
However, considering that...

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.360
the defendant was only 19 years old...

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.680
at the time of the crime,

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.880
his mind was not yet fully mature,

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.040
and he suffered an asthma attack...

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.600
during the accident...

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.240
and later...

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.760
turned himself in to the police voluntarily,

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.440
he showed a willingness to take responsibility.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.399
The letters of plea...

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.920
written by his university's professors and students...

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.200
have convinced me...

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:57.560
that the defendant is indeed a promising young man.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.919
The court should grant him...

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.640
a chance to turn over a new leaf.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.760
I hereby sentence...

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.680
the defendant, Qin Yi Wei,

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:10.840
for violating the Road Traffic Act by evading responsibility...

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.000
to twelve months' imprisonment,

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.720
with immediate execution.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.080
Wei Wei, don't worry.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.560
I will take care of anything you need in there.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.360
The most important thing is to learn to protect yourself.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.280
Let's go.

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:13.720
Don't worry too much.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.200
He'll be suffering terribly in prison.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.640
I won't go in with you. I have something to do.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.560
What are you going to do?

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.680
Don't do anything stupid.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.320
I know. I won't.

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.560
Judge Qin.

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.039
Prison is a place...

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.600
where rules must be obeyed.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.480
Managing prisons...

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.480
requires even greater adherence to the rules.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.080
In here,

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.160
rules are equal to everyone.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.640
Yes.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.280
I hope you understand.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.680
I'm not here...

00:29:04.681 --> 00:29:05.960
asking for any special treatment.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.000
I'm here to tell you...

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.360
that Han Kui Long was given a heavy sentence by me.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.360
Now, my son is locked up here.

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.799
He might send his men...

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.800
to deal with my son.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.279
If you don't put my son...

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.320
in a solitary cell,

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:18.960
you're giving them a chance.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.120
Judge Qin, to be honest,

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.600
no one who comes in here is any good.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.560
Many people have grudges against each other.

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.319
If every inmate who comes in here...

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.800
demands a solitary cell,

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:35.000
is this a prison or a hotel?

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.280
If that's the case,

00:29:37.281 --> 00:29:38.799
must something happen to my son...

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:39.920
before you can make arrangements?

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
I'll be honest with you.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.200
Actually, my son...

00:29:43.201 --> 00:29:44.800
had already been assaulted once while in custody...

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.560
at the Eastern District Police Station.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:51.039
That's because their security measures weren't good enough.

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.279
This is a prison.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.959
We have targeted security measures...

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.320
to ensure the safety of every inmate.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.280
Judge Qin, if you don't have faith in the prison system,

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.440
feel free to voice your opinion.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.599
But you absolutely cannot state this for the benefit...

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.600
of any one individual.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.919
It is a great honor to have the senior judge, Mr. Lu Wei De,

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:14.920
join us today for Legal Aid.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.639
Our listeners are very interested...

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:20.480
in a recent hit-and-run case that went to trial.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:21.960
What is your opinion, Judge Lu?

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.119
I will not comment...

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.280
on individual cases.

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.439
Because we must respect...

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.880
the court's decision.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.840
But we can analyze...

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.800
from the perspective of the rule of law.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.800
If in a case,

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.360
someone knows the law,

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.040
but doesn't abide by it,

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.400
and instigates others to evade responsibility,

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.520
and uses his influence...

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.480
to interfere with the judicial process,

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.320
this not only...

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.480
crosses the legal bottom line,

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:50.880
but also shakes the foundation...

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.880
of the judicial system.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:54.840
If a high-ranking public official...

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:57.039
is involved in a case...

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.279
of obstruction of justice,

00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.360
how should it be resolved?

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.360
I will strongly suggest...

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:02.759
the relevant departments...

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.200
to investigate immediately...

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.480
so that those who deserve punishment may be brought to justice.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.200
Hey,

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.480
this Judge Lu...

00:32:11.481 --> 00:32:13.000
is really abusing his power.

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.520
He actually used the radio interview to attack you.

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:16.799
He's afraid that you'll compete with him...

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.160
for the position of Chief Justice.

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.880
What he said...

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.200
will soon escalate public opinion.

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:23.879
They'll say you, as a judge,

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.200
are bending the law.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.680
Why aren't you reacting?

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.080
You're letting them criticize you?

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.200
What he's doing...

00:32:34.201 --> 00:32:35.680
will make Yi Wei safer.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.280
He knows how to use the media.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.440
We can do the same.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.120
As the former Chief Justice,

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.239
it's an honor to contribute...

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.600
to the cause of protecting women's rights.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.000
It's also my responsibility.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.960
Nowadays, in society,

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.160
there's a hotbed of violence that's often overlooked.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.160
And that's prison.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.160
One of the primary purposes of imprisonment...

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.759
is to give criminals...

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.520
a chance to turn over a new leaf.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:09.760
But if you're constantly immersed in violence in prison,

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.160
whether it's the perpetrator or the victim,

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.760
their humanity will be distorted.

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.199
In the future,

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.520
it will be very difficult...

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.280
for them to return to society.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.199
Violence not only hurts individuals,

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.360
but society as a whole.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.160
That's why we should step forward...

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.680
to build a fairer,

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.199
more humane society...

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.600
and contribute to it.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:34.400
Thank you.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.680
Our goal...

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.799
is to help every inmate...

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:41.920
build a new life.

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.080
Help them reintroduce themselves to society...

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.680
and reduce the rate of felonies...

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:49.600
and bring peace...

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:50.920
to society.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.959
This is a very meaningful...

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.240
and noble goal.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.200
- Warden. - Yes?

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.920
May I take a look inside the cell?

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:02.720
Open the door.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:06.920
Everyone, stand at attention!

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.600
Stand at attention!

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:19.120
The discipline and environment are good.

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:20.600
Warden.

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:21.920
You've managed it very well.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.520
Thank you. It's my duty.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.400
Hello, everyone.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.120
I'm Councilor Huang Xiao.

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.279
Do you have any complaints,

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.960
or any opinions you'd like to express?

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.320
No, sir.

00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:36.800
I'm not a sir.

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.479
I'm just representing the government...

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.520
to collect opinions.

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.600
Young man,

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.240
what crime did you commit?

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.080
Hit and run.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.480
Sentenced to 12 months.

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.080
Have you reflected on your actions since you came in?

00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.599
You're so young.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.960
If you're willing to change,

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.079
I'm sure you can contribute...

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.200
to society in the future.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.880
I believe in you.

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.480
Councilor Huang!

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Councilor Huang,

00:35:24.001 --> 00:35:25.800
what are your thoughts after inspecting the prison?

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.320
The Correctional Services Department is doing a good job.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:29.720
But I think...

00:35:29.721 --> 00:35:31.360
there is also room for improvement.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.160
Can you be more specific?

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.639
We should focus on the mental health...

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:37.760
and education of the inmates.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.400
Especially...

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.920
in light of the recent emergence of violent rhetoric in society.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.800
If such violent rhetoric were to spread into prisons,

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.479
it would inevitably impact...

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.800
the rehabilitation of the inmates.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.720
That's why I won't allow...

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.240
hatred and violence...

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.640
to spread in the prison.

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.439
Are you referring...

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.200
to the recent slander against Judge Qin Yu?

00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.400
You reminded me.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.160
This is a good example.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.720
I think when a person breaks the law,

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.320
and receives the punishment they deserve,

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:06.800
that should be the end of it.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.879
But these days, a lot of people...

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:11.000
use verbal abuse as personal attacks.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:12.959
This kind of thing should never be allowed...

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.040
in our society.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.760
I don't know Judge Qin.

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.520
But from the cases he's presided over in the past,

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.360
I think he's a just,

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:23.160
fair, and impartial judge.

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:27.000
What are you planning to do next, Councilor Huang?

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.079
I'll write down everything...

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.280
I've seen and heard in my report...

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.360
as a basis for future legislation.

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.519
It's to ensure that the public's right...

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:35.600
to accountability is respected.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.800
Thank you.

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.560
Excuse me, everyone.

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:41.080
Councilor Huang has another appointment.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.159
If you have any questions,

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.200
feel free to contact me.

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:45.880
This is my business card.

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.280
Boss.

00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.880
Do we really need a priest at the church?

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.279
I heard from Mr. Qiang...

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:01.400
that Young Master Gang was severely injured,

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:02.760
and almost died.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.280
Luckily, we got a priest to perform an exorcism on him.

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.439
He even said that his epilepsy...

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.440
was caused by a ghost possessing him.

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.279
So he wants to get a priest...

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.520
to perform an exorcism on him.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.399
On one hand, he wants a priest to perform an exorcism on him.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.200
On the other, he needs a girl to vent his frustrations.

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.000
Luckily, I'm smart.

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.000
I got the priest to come over...

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.880
for an exorcism at 1pm on Friday.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.439
I've also arranged for a massage girl...

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.240
to come at a different time.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.160
Here.

00:38:37.161 --> 00:38:38.200
Be careful, it's hot.

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:39.840
Sit down and drink slowly.

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:43.720
Mr. Fei.

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:45.640
Your business is doing well.

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.000
Thanks to my regulars.

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:49.920
Just like you.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.760
Every day at 1:15pm,

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.599
just thinking about Judge Qin,

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.120
here you are!

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.200
I wouldn't have noticed if you hadn't said that.

00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:59.800
I feel off without your coffee every day.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.319
Give me a minute.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.800
- I'll make yours right away. - Okay.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:19.400
(Hokong Maximum Security Prison)

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.560
I'm sorry.

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.600
Li messed up.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:27.800
There's still a whole year.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.440
There's still time. There's no need to rush.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.119
It's all that Councilor's fault.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.480
He went to inspect the prison.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.280
The prison is under tight surveillance now.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.240
I said there's time. No need to rush.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.600
Luo Qiang...

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:45.880
said your brother wants to hire a priest.

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.280
My brother said...

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:50.400
he believed epilepsy was caused by ghost possession.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.040
He won't take medicine.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.000
So he needs a priest to help him perform an exorcism.

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.800
He's out of his mind.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:58.880
I don't think so.

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:00.839
Besides the priest,

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.040
he's also looking for girls.

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.000
He's perfectly normal.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:18.680
Xiao Lie.

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.840
You and your brother are very close.

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.880
Future matters at home...

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.360
are now in the hands of you two brothers.

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.440
You didn't like to get involved before.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:32.160
That's why I kept a lot of things from you.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000
You didn't know.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:37.520
That's why you couldn't guess what my decision would be.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.199
Twenty years ago,

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.480
how did I...

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.240
rise to the top so quickly?

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.519
Because I was targeted...

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.920
by a very powerful interest group.

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:52.880
How powerful is it?

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:55.320
In politics and business?

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.080
In the police force and among gangsters.

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:05.880
All of them.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.560
They never show their faces.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.160
They just send messages through middlemen.

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.000
I worked for them.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.200
They supported me,

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.080
and I could...

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:21.560
grow step by step.

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.560
If they're so powerful,

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.400
why did you end up in prison?

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.040
I was too arrogant.

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.400
They used the assault case...

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:33.960
to teach me a lesson.

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.840
They've already agreed...

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.480
on my future benefits.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Is it worth it?

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:43.200
Yes.

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.800
I can help both of you brothers to the top.

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:49.480
I can also make our Han Group...

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:53.960
the largest gambling empire in Hokong.

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.000
It's worth it.

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.000
I'm almost there.

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.400
The land acquisition plan of the Old City District...

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.040
will begin soon.

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.800
Let's not do anything unnecessary.

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.520
We have to preserve our strength.

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:11.560
People who only talk about profit...

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.600
don't care about morals.

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.280
We're in the open while they're in the dark.

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.200
Aren't we at a disadvantage?

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:20.960
Their identities are top secret.

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.640
Ordinary people can't see them.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.480
There are certain symbols...

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:28.960
you should be wary of the moment you see them.

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:34.960
Plum blossoms...

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.120
represents us,

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:38.560
the gangsters.

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.320
Diamonds.

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:44.120
Hearts.

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.120
Spades.

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:49.120
Business,

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:50.360
police,

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:51.680
and politics.

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:53.640
When you see these,

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.160
you have to be careful.

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.800
You have to be wary.

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:58.760
You can't touch these people.

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:00.760
You can't offend them.

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.360
They only care about profit.

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:08.800
Profit...

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:11.079
is your greatest weapon.

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.120
Do you understand?

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.320
Son,

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.040
Go check on your little sister, okay?

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:52.560
Good boy.

00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:00.480
See if you need anything else.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.000
We can hold out for a while.

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:05.680
I can't keep going on like this with the kids.

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:09.680
Any news from the Old City District?

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.759
My dad secretly told me...

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.199
that Qi Chang Rong's men...

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.480
suddenly behaved themselves.

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:15.999
They didn't commit murder or arson.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.120
They didn't fight or cause trouble.

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.320
But they sent someone to my house.

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.320
I think they suspect me.

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:26.080
Because you were the last person to see Qi Chang Rong.

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:27.920
They'll never guess...

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.200
that you would stay here.

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.479
If Qi Chang Rong's body is found,

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.280
it won't just be the Old City Gang.

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:35.999
The police won't let me go either.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.680
That's why I need to get out of here as soon as possible.

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:40.560
I'll arrange for you to leave.

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.720
Can you leave after Friday?

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:43.920
Why?

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:46.960
What could be more important than this right now?

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.000
Because someone is going to die that day.

00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:59.080
I'll see you off.

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:01.440
I promised Wei.

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:25.160
Judge Qin.

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:37.880
I bought it for the kids.

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.000
Be careful.

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:47.040
Come back safely.

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:48.880
Okay.
