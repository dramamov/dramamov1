[Episode 14]

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:45.840
Is she an enemy?

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.880
She was.

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:49.920
And now?

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.470
Whoever she is now
is none of your business.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.789
Fine.

[In Memory of Late Mother Qingyu]

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.170
If your mother were still alive,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.150
seeing you so troubled by love,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.840
she would probably laugh at you.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.520
Troubled by love?

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.820
Before I avenge my mother,

[In Memory of Late Mother Qingyu]

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.620
I have no time to think about such things.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.020
Why did you come to Yujing

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.880
this time?

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.160
How long will you stay?

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.590
Is it for the wedding?

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.310
I'm not interested

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.380
in joining the fun.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.000
I'm here to see a patient.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.260
I'll leave after that.

[Wutong Mansion]

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.560
Make sure to send Lord Ling

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.260
back to Zhengnian Hall.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.810
Yes.

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.030
With me here,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.440
he's unlikely to die.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.329
Your Highness.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.640
Xia Jingshi took Xiao Weiran away?

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:50.340
How did you know?

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.340
[Wutong Mansion]

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.079
I locked him up in the patrol unit

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.360
precisely to make it easier
for them to rescue him.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.090
If I'd kept him in my residence,

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.100
do you think Prime Minister Zhuang
and his people

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.630
would've dared make a move?

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:02.590
But Xia Jingshi

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.740
didn't go to get him himself.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.400
He went through the envoys
of the two nations.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.240
At the Ministry of Rites,

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.260
they promised Xia Jingshi

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.060
that they would help him
bring Miss Yixiao back.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.720
Xia Jingshi probably thought

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.900
it wouldn't work out,

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.030
so he gave the opportunity

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.030
to Xiao Weiran.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.700
Which means

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.780
Xia Jingshi
has already tacitly acknowledged

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.680
that Miss Yixiao

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.880
isn't your prisoner,

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.710
but stayed voluntarily.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.320
Xiao Weiran switched sides.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.300
He saw the play couldn't go on,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.260
so he just dropped the act.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.470
If you're right,

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.430
Xiao Weiran

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.290
probably won't return to Yujing.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.120
Xia Jingshi
will naturally reassign him elsewhere.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.400
If he stays in Susha,

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.920
he would be under our close surveillance.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.130
Where is she?

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:45.430
Lu Ke?

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.150
Didn't you send him

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.210
to chase Xun Xiang?

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.940
Oh, you mean Miss Yixiao.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.920
She's still at Zhengnian Hall.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.240
I helped her save Ning Fei,

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:58.430
and she thinks one thank‑you

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.850
is enough to brush me off?

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.710
Exactly.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.030
If it weren't for

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.780
your sake,

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.030
Lord Ling

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.460
wouldn't care about that Ning Fei.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.680
Miss Yixiao should at least offer

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.880
to treat you to a meal.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.960
So rude.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.030
Go tell the kitchen
to prepare some good dishes

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.090
and a few jars of fine wine.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.890
Call her over.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.390
And invite Miss Ling

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.550
and those kids too.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.050
Your Highness,

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.160
you helped her,

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.320
and now you're inviting her to dinner?

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.900
Inviting her to dinner?

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.420
Don't I need to eat?

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.640
Don't you need to eat?

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.920
I've already eaten, Your Highness.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.040
Yixiao?

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.870
She's not here.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.090
She sent Ning Fei off

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.490
and left just after dusk.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.890
Where did she go?

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.330
She didn't say.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.190
I thought she went back

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.050
to the First Prince's residence.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.030
I knew you'd come.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.260
With your personality,

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.600
you'd have to get to the bottom of it
no matter what.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.659
Aren't you going to tell me the truth?

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.600
On the cliff,

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.600
were you that eager

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.620
to see me dead?

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.120
I never once thought of

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.850
killing you.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.560
But since I was working with him,

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.610
I couldn't let you stand in my way.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:10.480
Meng Junran,

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.150
when will the military funds

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.390
you promised arrive?

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.560
Yesterday, 100,000 taels of silver

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.720
were already sent off under the escort

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.190
of the Rongtong Escort Agency.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.120
They'll soon reach Pingling City.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.330
I've fulfilled my promise to you.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.100
But what about you?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.680
Didn't you say that with our plan,

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.340
we would definitely win
the Battle of Pingling?

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.910
You don't need to tell me.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:32.920
I know it was
that female commander of yours

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.120
who ruined our plan with a single arrow.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.500
Since that's the case,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.120
Prince of Zhennan,
why don't you execute her

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.450
to uphold military law?

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:43.510
What?

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.340
You can't bear to do it?

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.890
One must pay the price for their mistakes.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.120
How Yixiao should be punished

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.220
is an internal matter
for the Zhennan Army.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.730
It's none of your concern.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.480
Who is that

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.860
masked man?

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:03.190
If you hadn't

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.450
relentlessly tried to kill him that day,

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.360
would we

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.610
be in this mess today?

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.320
Yixiao!

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:14.270
Yixiao!

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:15.140
Yixiao!

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.700
Stop!

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:16.880
Your Highness,

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.000
don't try to stop me.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.600
That person from Susha
definitely has ill intentions.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.620
He'll pass here

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:21.750
on his way back to Susha.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:22.430
Let me kill him.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.960
Yixiao. Yixiao, calm down!

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.450
Your Highness,
you don't want me to kill him?

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.180
Does that mean you want me dead?

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.030
What are you talking about?

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:32.360
You know I wouldn't kill you.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.670
Why are you forcing me?

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.000
Don't be deceived by that person.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.909
We're running out of time.

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:37.040
Just let me kill him.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.710
No one deceived me.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.300
This is all my own choice.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:47.500
Your own choice?

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:50.470
Yixiao,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.580
it's all right.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.620
I know.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.190
I know that you don't understand me now.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:55.630
You will understand in the future.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:56.480
Everything I've done

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.790
is for our future.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:07:59.730
Give me the bow now

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:00.800
and come back with me.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.240
Okay?

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.280
Give me the bow!

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.200
Whatever your reasons,

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:09.510
you cannot sacrifice

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:10.680
the people of Zhennan Pass!

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.340
War always costs lives!

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.860
I'm ordering you now

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.150
to come back with me!

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.570
Soldiers spill blood

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.950
and die on the battlefield

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:18.680
so the common people

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.800
can live in peace

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.160
and avoid slaughter!

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:22.780
But for your own selfish reasons,

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.240
you want to sacrifice the lives

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.770
of 300,000 civilians at Zhennan Pass!

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:27.180
How could you be so cruel,

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.900
so heartless?

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:31.560
I am cruel?

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.130
Let me tell you,

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.360
if I had the slightest bit of

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.400
soft-heartedness,

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.120
I, Xia Jingshi,

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.120
wouldn't have lived to see this day.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:41.030
Yixiao,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.530
I'm begging you.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.080
Just pretend nothing happened.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.440
Pretend you don't know anything.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.300
Go back with me!

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.390
I won't go back!

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.890
Your Highness,

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.360
I'm sorry I cannot obey your orders today.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.910
If you insist on this path,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.400
I'll kill him even if it costs me my life!

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:01.270
Yixiao,

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.550
I knew this path

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:05.080
would be full of obstacles,

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.600
but I never imagined

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.120
you'd become one of them.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.770
I also never imagined

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:16.000
you could be so ruthless.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.360
Fine.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.240
So you really want to do this,

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:22.870
right?

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.380
Didn't you just say

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.410
everything you had done

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.720
is for our future?

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:43.720
Then right now,

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.870
I'll act on behalf of my future self

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:46.600
and stop you.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.460
Will you let me?

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.660
I have never begged you for anything.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.080
Today,

00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:59.630
I'm begging you.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:33.720
No.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.340
Yixiao!

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:50.290
Put down the bow!

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:54.660

At the Battle of Pingling,

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:56.320
your plan

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.720
was to use the lives
of hundreds of thousands

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.870
of civilians in the city as bait,

00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:59.470
wasn't it?

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.510
Once Feng Suige had breached Zhennan Pass,

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:04.040
he would not only have died,

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:06.220
but would also have been branded
with the stigma of a city massacre.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.560
Of course he must die.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.150
Only his death

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.040
can throw Susha into utter chaos.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.270
Only with his death

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:12.910
will I one day

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:14.910
be free from fighting on two fronts.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:15.440
Yixiao,

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.720
you must understand that

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.240
he is our real enemy.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.000
Are the civilians in that city

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.370
your enemies too?

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:26.510
Yes.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.490
So many people can be sacrificed.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:31.480
I, Fu Yixiao,

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.330
just a mere officer of the Zhennan Army—

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.120
what does it matter if I die?

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.840
I never intended

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.520
to kill you.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:42.270
If that day

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:43.910
I had truly wanted to kill you,

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:45.120
how would that arrow have ended up

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.120
in your shoulder?

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.630
Well then,

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.270
thank you for not killing me.

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.310
Xia Jingshi,

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.880
I'm asking you one last time—

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.510
who is

00:13:58.510 --> 00:13:59.370
the masked man?

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:01.030
Yixiao,

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:03.550
can you

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:04.550
come back to me?

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.840
I'm asking who that person is!

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.650
Answer me!

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.550
I don't expect you to understand me.

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:11.970
I only want to tell you

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:14.750
that I used to think

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:15.670
everything I wanted

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.000
was the most important,

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.920
but after losing you, I realized

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:22.750
you were what mattered most.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.600
I never truly wanted

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.440
to kill you.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.410
Give me another chance.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.890
You still refuse to tell me.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:34.510
I know.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.810
It was all my fault before.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:37.670
Whatever happened before,

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:38.270
it was all my fault.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:39.320
I did everything wrong.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.270
I know that whatever I say now

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:41.040
is useless.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.230
All I ask

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.160
is for you to come back to me.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.050
As long as you come back to me,

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:47.450
I'll do anything you ask.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.150
I can give up everything.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.210
We can be like before.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.550
Let's start over.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:53.870
Let's be together again,

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:54.360
okay?

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:59.320
You look ridiculous now.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.130
No matter what you say,

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.980
there's no going back.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.630
When you shot that arrow,

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.270
the old Fu Yixiao

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:13.360
was dead.

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:17.120
You killed her yourself.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.240
You once saved me,

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.470
but you also killed me yourself.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.960
From now on,

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.600
our debts are settled.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.060
We owe each other nothing.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:41.550
Next time we meet,

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.120
we'll be enemies.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.360
Ning Fei is dead.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.700
Tell Xiao Weiran about it.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:04.770
Think of it as closure.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:54.800
I was careless.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.720
I never imagined

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.840
you'd choose this moment

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.080
to meet Xia Jingshi.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:01.250
When did you get here?

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:02.600
Looks like

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.000
I can't escape

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.200
your grasp after all.

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:06.400
What did he do to you?

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:07.750
Did you two fight?

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:10.690
I'm fine.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:12.960
Answer me.

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:14.790
What happened to you?

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.369
I'm really fine.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.210
Don't worry.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:19.640
I'll tell you

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:21.609
what I need to tell you.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.000
I'm doing this for your own good.

I was worried you'd have nightmares.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.030
Aren't you going to ask me

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:07.230
what I dreamed about?

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.680
I can guess.

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:14.350
Those dreams aren't scary at all.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.010
I couldn't see colors in them,

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:17.800
so I knew they were just dreams.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.630
I remember...

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:23.110
I had just left

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:24.660
Xia Jingshi's.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.300
You were probably just too tired.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.670
You fell asleep

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.920
as soon as you left Xia Jingshi's.

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:34.090
I fell asleep?

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:35.550
Yes.

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:38.520
You really can sleep anywhere.

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:40.680
You actually fell asleep on the street.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.540
It really scared them at the time.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.160
But I told them not to worry.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.280
You must

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.840
have been exhausted.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:48.850
Exactly. Too tired.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.400
It's not dawn yet.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:56.570
Go back to sleep.

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:58.600
I'll keep watch at the door.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.920
You can rest easy.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.290
I'll keep

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.920
these candles burning.

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:04.040
There's no need.

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:05.440
I'm fine now.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:07.010
You should go rest too.

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:38.870
Feng Suige,

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:40.800
thank you.

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:02.710
Who told you to provoke her?

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:03.960
Those are just common methods

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:04.980
to treat hysteria.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:05.750
She has a head injury

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:06.750
and a blood clot in her brain.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:07.590
Any stimulus

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:08.720
or emotional outburst

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.000
could cause her clot

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.200
to burst like a flood.

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:12.590
She's having nightmares

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:13.640
because she was

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:14.660
overstimulated.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.440
If you want her

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.570
to live peacefully,

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.320
stay away from all the chaos.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.250
Where are you taking me?

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:28.270
What?

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.420
You think I would harm you?

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.720
What are you up to?

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:34.590
Whatever it is,

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:36.860
it can't be anything bad.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.350
If you don't tell me,

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:39.000
I won't go.

[Wutong Mansion]

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.020
The wind picked up last night,

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.800
and today the sky's full of dark clouds.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.510
I'm worried it might rain

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:49.880
and ruin the herb fields,

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.280
so I want to check on them.

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:53.060
It's a long journey.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.070
I just want someone to talk to.

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:58.930
The dignified First Prince of Susha

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.110
actually has the leisure

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:01.570
to farm?

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:04.030
What a coincidence.

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:05.180
I'd like to see it.

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:22.070
What are your plans now?

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:23.920
Plans?

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.250
Since you left Xia Jingshi,

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:29.240
you're no longer a female general
of Jinxiu.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:29.830
And if I were to

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:30.830
make you my concubine,

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.630
it would seem far too frivolous.

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:34.560
Have you ever thought about

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.540
joining me?

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:40.900
Joining you?

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.260
What's in it for me?

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:44.920
What's in it for you?

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:48.400
You'll officially work for me.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.550
Whatever happens from now on,

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:50.580
I'll protect you

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:52.180
and keep you safe.

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:53.590
I know

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:55.910
you're trying to find out

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.000
what exactly Xia Jingshi

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:57.640
told me.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.310
You can be straightforward.

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:01.350
There's no need to beat around the bush.

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:02.440
That day in the tent,

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.830
the one meeting with Xia Jingshi

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:04.920
was a masked man.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.030
Xia Jingshi called him Meng Junran.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:08.160
No matter how I pressed him,

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.620
Xia Jingshi refused
to reveal his identity.

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:11.790
In the Battle of Pingling,

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:12.810
their plan

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:14.870
was to lure you into the city,

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.640
use hundreds of thousands of civilians
as shields,

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.580
and wipe out your Feng Battalion.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.700
Use civilians as shields?

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.310
If you had broken through Zhennan Pass

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:25.750
and entered Pingling City,

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:27.310
would you have slaughtered the civilians?

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:28.110
Of course not.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.640
What if among the civilians

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.310
there were hidden crossbowmen

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:32.620
out to kill you?

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.550
When you can't tell the enemy

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:35.760
from the civilians,

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.160
what would you do?

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.190
I have to kill them all.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.530
In that case,

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.240
you'd become the true culprit
behind the massacre

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.000
of hundreds of thousands in Pingling City.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.520
Even if you managed to survive

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.650
and return to Susha,

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.400
your reputation would be ruined.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.350
Everyone would see you

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:52.810
as a bloodthirsty killer.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:54.680
What a clever scheme.

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:56.350
It seems that

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:57.920
if not for that arrow
you shot at me that day,

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:58.550
I'd have died

00:24:58.550 --> 00:24:59.950
without a proper burial.

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:02.890
I guess it was a blessing in disguise.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:03.600
By the way,

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.130
thank you for the gold-threaded soft armor
you gave me—

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:07.060
it saved my life.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.610
But why didn't you use it yourself?

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:13.450
With my martial skills,
I didn't need to wear it.

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:17.240
I know what you're about to say.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:19.030
That I'm so arrogant,

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.120
yet I still ended up defeated by you.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.240
I wasn't thinking that at all.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.070
You said it.

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:28.320
A blessing in disguise, right?

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:43.090
Whose home is this?

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.310
Mine.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.030
It's quite similar

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:47.490
to my home in Zhennan Pass.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:48.780
Looks like

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.780
you're not fond of
living in a grand mansion either.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:55.350
That's my mother's hairpin.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:00.670
You mean

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:02.720
the former empress of Susha?

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.360
This is my mother's private residence.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.970
When she was young,

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.960
she often led troops in battles.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.200
Every time she returned from war

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.310
and didn't want to go back to the palace,

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:15.160
she would come here

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.220
and stay for a while

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:18.370
to escape all those constraints.

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:22.790
I never imagined the former empress
of Susha

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:24.590
was such a free-spirited woman.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.030
My mother always yearned

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:31.690
for a life of freedom and ease.

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:33.800
If it hadn't been for my father,

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.070
she would never have trapped herself

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.140
within the palace walls.

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:40.270
So...

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:42.400
you once lived here too?

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:44.830
When I was little,

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:46.680
I often stayed here with my mother.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.480
There were no palace rules here—

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.680
just freedom and joy.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:52.920
She would spend her days with us

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.080
planting herbs

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:55.730
and tending flowers here.

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:02.920
Sometimes when my father came,

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.620
he'd take me and Xiyang

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.500
to the stream to catch fish.

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:23.960
Hug it.

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:33.750
Aside from

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:34.920
the four of us,

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:36.640
no one knew

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.100
what this place used to be.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:47.800

According to our previous agreement,

our cooperation

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:15.240
ends here.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:18.610
I said before

that if you want to leave,

I won't force you to stay.

just to tell me this?

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.830
Yes.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:39.850
But not exactly.

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:41.290
Then what is it?

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.640
Stop beating around the bush.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:43.480
Just say it.

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:46.960
Whatever

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.280
Xia Jingshi's plan is,

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:50.810
it only targets Susha

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:51.640
and me.

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:53.630
It has nothing to do with you.

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:55.330
If you're willing,

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.000
I can find you

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:59.360

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:01.730
You can take those children with you too.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.830
So you don't want me to help you find

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:06.070
that masked man?

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:09.480
Even without you,

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:12.190
I can find him on my own.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:24.540
Feng Suige,

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:26.530
you seem

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.620
rather unfamiliar today.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.380
Your sudden concern for me

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:32.010
makes me a bit scared.

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.240
What are you up to?

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.660
What purpose can I have?

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:38.000
Whatever your purpose,

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:40.590
you clearly don't have good intentions.

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:44.220
Feng Suige,

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:45.830
since the day

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:46.920
you arrested me,

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.180
I've wanted to tell you

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.220
that even though you hold every advantage

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:53.550
and seem certain to win,

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:55.270
you will never

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:56.160
beat me.

00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:58.560
Why?

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.110
Because I always know

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:19.350
what you're thinking.

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:34.930
There's quite a big fish here.

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:08.120
♪ Take down the setting sun as my heart ♪

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:12.060

♪ Like a fleeting flower falling into ♪

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.210
She's having nightmares

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:29.880
because she was

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.480
overstimulated.

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.400
♪ My eyes ♪

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.240

to live peacefully,

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:33.510
stay away from all the chaos.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:38.050
Your Highness.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.420
We found Xun Xiang.

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:40.710
Lu Ke is watching him.

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:42.679
I see.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.710
When she wakes,

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:45.850
escort her back to the residence.

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:47.110
Be extremely careful.

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:47.960
Yes.

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.390
When you planned to kill,

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:47.670
did you ever think about your daughter?

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:55.000
Do you plan to surrender,

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:56.360
or should I have your whole family
arrested

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.490
to keep you company?

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:02.200
Get in!

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.340
Your Highness,

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:09.070
the Xun family
is distantly related to the Empress.

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:09.960
Aren't we being

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.190
a bit too conspicuous?

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:13.100
Fu Yixiao is under my protection.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:14.840
I want everyone in Yujing City

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.400
to know about this.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.860
Whoever dares to harm her,

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:19.670
I will kill them.

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:37.200
Your Majesty, I came

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.360
to report something important.

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:42.920
Recently, someone actually

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.400
attempted to assassinate
a member of my household.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.030
We've caught the culprit.

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:48.740
He's outside the hall.

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:52.190
Are the Ministry of Justice

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:53.960
and the Court of Judicial Review
both closed?

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:54.920
If someone tries to assassinate you,

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.070
just go to them.

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:58.930
What do you mean by bringing the assassin

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.210
into the palace?

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.440
It's because this person
has a special identity.

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.000
I have no authority to handle him.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
I request Your Majesty's judgment.

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:06.920
Lu Ke.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:13.480
Kneel!

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.110
Your Majesty, spare me!

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:18.440
Your Majesty, spare me!

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:22.710
Is this the child from the Xun family?

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.630
Yes.

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.920
Your Majesty, you remember

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:26.920
the Empress's relatives

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.070
very well.

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.660
Are you saying

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.320
that this person's
assassination attempt at your residence

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.920
is connected to the Empress?

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:37.970
Your Majesty, you are wise.

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.060
The truth and justice

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:41.950
rest entirely on your judgment.

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:44.150
I'm afraid the Empress already knows

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:45.190
that I brought Xun Xiang

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:46.120
into the palace.

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:48.320
As for how deeply

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.550
she is involved,

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.320
Your Majesty,

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:52.680
please wait and see.

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:56.320
You seem quite confident.

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:16.980
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:19.510
Your Majesty.

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:22.550
First Prince,

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.800
you brought someone covered in blood

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:25.960
before His Majesty.

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.590
If it startled His Majesty,

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:29.450
what punishment would befit you?

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.360
His Majesty is a warrior emperor

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:33.280
who has expanded our territories

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.880
and achieved unparalleled merit.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.740
He will not be startled so easily.

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.290
Empress,

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.230
why are you here?

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:41.590
I heard today that

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:43.960
the First Prince
entered the palace unexpectedly

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.780
and feared he might displease you again.

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.320
His Majesty didn't sleep well last night

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.050
and woke up dizzy this morning.

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:50.510
First Prince,

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.670
please speak to His Majesty patiently.

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:54.270
Don't upset him.

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:56.030
Your Majesty,

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:57.800
I truly admire

00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:59.690
your concern for His Majesty.

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:01.320
However,

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.250
you may not know,

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.380
but General Xun

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:07.190
has already confessed everything.

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.630
I don't understand

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:24.850
what First Prince is saying.

00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:26.800
But if I weren't here today,

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:28.270
some matters

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.600
might have been impossible to clarify.

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:34.150
Our Zhuang family and the Xun family
are only distant relatives,

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:35.810
with very little connection.

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:37.330
I don't know

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.510
how Xun Xiang offended

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:39.840
the First Prince today.

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.350
But no matter what the Xun family
has done,

00:39:42.350 --> 00:39:43.870
I am unaware.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.800
How this matter should be handled

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.590
is for Your Majesty to decide.

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:50.210
Although I'm not welcomed in Yujing,

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.360
everything should follow the principle

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.150
of fair rewards and punishments.

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:55.280
Otherwise, how can I continue

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:56.530
living here?

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:58.060
First Prince,

00:39:58.960 --> 00:39:59.900
when has His Majesty ever let you

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:01.230
suffer any injustice?

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:03.050
-Isn't this...
-Empress.

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:05.160
This is not the harem.

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:06.900
I'll talk to you

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:08.630
when I get back.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:09.970
You may leave now.

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:20.520
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:34.320
I know you suspect the Empress

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.450
of involvement,

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.700
but you have no solid evidence.

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:40.570
Didn't he say nothing at all?

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.390
Does it matter

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:43.760
whether he did or not?

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.260
I am truly innocent...

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.440
Xiyang is about to be married.

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:54.730
This is the biggest matter right now.

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:57.150
You have been close to her
since childhood.

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:59.140
Before her wedding,

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.640
you cannot let the Jinxiu people

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.440
see our royal family as divided.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.400
Your Majesty,
since you said you will not pursue it,

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.680
then we will not.

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:09.440
But in the future,

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.110
if I act against anyone
around the Empress,

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:13.160
I ask that you treat it the same way.

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:14.050
How dare you!

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:17.180
She is your mother after all!

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.540
She has never been my mother.

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:24.070
For the sake
of a mere Jinxiu prisoner of war,

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:25.110
you're deliberately

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:26.300
opposing me today.

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.750
No matter how lawless you are,

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.890
there are limits.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.980
After all, Susha

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:35.860
is still ruled by me.

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:37.860
Of course you're the ruler.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.230
Wasn't it also you back then

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:40.630
who tacitly allowed them

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:43.720
to murder my mother?

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:49.760
Your Majesty!

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:55.360
Your Majesty!

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:56.400
Please don't be angry.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.440
-Your health is more important.
-Your Highness.

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.150
Your Highness, kneel, please.

00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.860
I'm begging you,

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:01.330
please kneel now!

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:09.590
I issued a strict order long ago

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:11.630
forbidding anyone

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:14.270
from mentioning the late Empress.

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:17.070
How dare you defy my decree?

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.540
Why forbid it?

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:22.940
Could it be that you feel guilty?

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:24.690
What did you say?

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.350
Do you really want me to repeat it?

00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:30.640
Convey my imperial order:

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:32.880
The First Prince has committed
great insubordination

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.140
and defied his elders.

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.150
He is to return to his residence
and reflect on his conduct.

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:39.320
Before Xiyang's wedding,
the ancestral offering ceremony

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:42.770
will be performed instead
by the Second Prince, Chengyang.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:49.930
Your Highness!

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.360
I shall take my leave as well.

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:02.000
Let's go.
