[Episode 25]

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.980
In mid-1941,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.570
the Japanese army was vigorously

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.180
preparing for
the Pacification Operation,

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.570
trying to boost
economic plunder of the occupied areas

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.620
and destroy the Chinese army's

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.660
anti-Japanese armed forces
behind enemy lines.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.160

[Pacification Committee
Preparatory Meeting]

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.050
Let us toast to the smooth conclusion

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.100
of the Pacification Committee's

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.100
preparatory meeting.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.860
Cheers.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.810
Major General.

[New Asia Hotel]

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.580
The Pacification Committee's
secret radio code

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.020
will be settled today.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.700
With our current relationship,

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.900
is it appropriate to talk about this?

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.180
We have different stances.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.580
So all this time,

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.020
no matter how we secretly competed,

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.050
I had nothing to say.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.740
But you don't have to make
a desperate move for help, right?

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.580
You know very well

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.980
what kind of person Liang Jingyuan is.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.740
Working with him is like
asking a tiger for its skin.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.060
My niece.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.620
Yes, yes.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.530
Let's head over there.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.140
Liang Jingyuan really knows
how to climb up.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.940
I never thought
the Pacification Committee

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.820
would actually make him
a committee member.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.530
If you had a wife
willing to use her family money

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.380
to smooth things over for you,

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.650
you'd climb faster than he does.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.020
Hello, Director Lee.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.820
Hello, Director Lee.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.060
Hello, Director Lee.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.620
Director Lee.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.940
Mr. Lin and Mr. Tang are here too.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.500
Mr. Lee.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.380
Major General Sasaki has arrived.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.940
This is Lieutenant General Yasui
from the East Asia Development Board.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.730
He is also one of the advisers
to the Pacification Committee.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.730
Mr. Yasui.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.380
It's an honor to meet you.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.500
Mr. Lee.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.820
I've heard much about you.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.940
Grand Duke and I are old friends.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.620
Back when he was serving
as ambassador to the UK,

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.820
he often mentioned you to me.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.210
I didn't expect to meet you here.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.500
May we speak privately?

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.060
I'd like to have a private chat
with Mr. Lee.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.060
Please, go ahead.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.580
Secretary Gu.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.260
Since Mr. Yasui
has an interpreter with him,

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.700
you don't need to accompany me.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.060
Alright, Director Lee.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.380
Please come in.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.290
I will definitely think of
something for you.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.260
Let's talk.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.460
Cheers.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.140
Mr. Liang, what's the matter

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:02.700
calling me out?

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.700
I just saw it all.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.820
They didn't let you in.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.620
What does that tell you?

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.140
He's already treating you differently.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.700
I'm used to it.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.900
I'm just an assistant.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.620
It's kind of strange, though.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.020
Lieutenant General Yasui

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.170
suddenly came here.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.620
On the surface, Mr. Yasui

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.690
is an adviser
to the Pacification Committee.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.620
But in reality, he's here to investigate

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.500
those in the New Government's
intelligence agencies

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.740
who secretly have ties
to the British and American forces.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.260
Joseph Lee is British, after all.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:49.500
Mr. Liang,

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.770
are you planning to
move against Mr. Lee?

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.900
But as far as I know,

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.140
Mr. Yasui and Grand Duke Tonoji

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.500
have been old friends of many years.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.340
Would he not show
Grand Duke some respect?

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.220
Stop saying Mr. Liang.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.340
I've already told you we are friends.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.620
Let me put it this way.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.410
Grand Duke Tonoji and Mr. Yasui

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.500
do have a good relationship.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.740
But in the struggle between

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.740
the Tonoji family and the Tōjō faction,

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.500
he has always remained neutral.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.500
Moreover, Grand Duke

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.930
was the ambassador
to the UK for many years.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.620
All his family assets are in London.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.740
If war breaks out
with Britain and America,

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.220
the first to suffer will be him.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.500
Besides, he's been bedridden
for over a year.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.020
We don't know whether he'll wake up.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.900
So for Joseph Lee,

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.020
is the Tonoji family

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.050
a life-saving talisman
or a death warrant?

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:51.980
What do you think?

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.620
Please, Liang, enlighten me.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.220
This is a letter of accusation.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.620
I've already
written the contents for you

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.860
in your identity and tone,

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.980
accusing the British Joseph Lee
of colluding with Britain and America.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.650
It only needs your signature.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.260
But if I sign this letter of accusation,

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.220
then Mr. Lee will be doomed.

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:42.530
Let me ask you.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.050
You're always thinking of him.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:45.220
But have you ever thought

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.340
whether he's ever thought of you?

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.260
If Joseph Lee always remains

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.530
the director
of the Cryptography Institute,

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.530
he'll always keep you under him.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.530
Are you willing?

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.380
As long as you
sign this letter of accusation,

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.770
Major General Sasaki will sign

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:00.770
your appointment letter.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.500
Then you will be the Code Officer

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.500
for the Pacification Committee.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.170
Sasaki will be your big tree to rely on.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.020
Let alone one set of codes,

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:13.410
all your talents

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.200
[1941, Pacification Committee]

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.140
will be seen by others.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:40.840
[Letter of Appointment]

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.570
Did Yasui say anything to you?

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.660
What did Liang Jingyuan say to you?

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.940
The Pacification Committee
has already adopted

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.060
the code he designed.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.140
And the one you designed

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.420
was rejected by Nanjing. Did you know?

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:39.300
He said you went behind my back

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.810
and gave the Japanese

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:43.420
a highly sophisticated code.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.420
It seems your new assistant

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.540
is quite capable.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.260
But I still have to remind you.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.690
Even if the Pacification
Committee uses your code,

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:09.540
we will not stop here.

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:19.420
I will also remind you one last time.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.420
Don't trust Liang Jingyuan too much.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.540
I understand.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.850
Now, looking at

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.660
the recovery of the leg nerves,

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.540
on a scale of one to ten,

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.900
rate the intensity of
the sensation you feel.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:33.260
One means no sensation at all.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.380
Ten means very strong sensation.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.490
Then let's begin.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:44.940
How intense is it?

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:51.940
Two or three.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.260
I understand.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.540
Then how about here?

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:13.660
How is it?

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:17.570
Five, I think.

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:21.380
Doctor.

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:24.940
The corridor is less than
100 meters long,

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.940
yet she needs ten minutes
to walk it with a walker.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.940
It's been such a long time.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.180
Why hasn't she recovered yet?

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.780
Although Mrs. Lee's spinal injury

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.940
has completely healed,

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:44.690
spinal nerves recovery

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:46.940
is slower than expected.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.380
So,

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:51.540
with her current nerve sensation,

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.450
being able to get out of bed

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:57.540
is already a miracle.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:03.540
She still needs to continue
using nerve-nourishing medication

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.690
and increase rehabilitation training.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.140
Take it slowly.

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:14.380
Well then, I'll take my leave.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.540
I'll walk them out.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.180
That really hurt.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.140
Is who lives on the top floor
really so important

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.450
that it's worth such a big risk?

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:55.690
Don't worry about me.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:56.780
Once we find out the result,

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.140
I have ways to get out of it.

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.540
How about on your side?
Is it going smoothly?

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.250
The code plan
given to me by the Organization

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.420
has already been submitted to Nanjing.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.340
In a few days,

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.420
the Pacification Committee

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.100
will officially use our code.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.660
But I still don't feel
entirely reassured.

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.490
It's always good to be cautious.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:19.940
But remember,

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:21.490
don't put too much pressure on yourself.

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:25.660
Much of our territory behind enemy lines

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:27.940
and the Kuomintang's
Loyal Salvation Army

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.420
have all been included

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.100
in the primary target area
of this operation.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:32.180
Only by gaining control

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.180
of the secret radio code
of the Pacification Committee

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.380
can we possibly learn about

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.140
the puppet army's operational movements.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.180
From what I know of Gu Yangshan,

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.660
he will definitely not give up.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:46.180
Since the Wannan Incident,

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.180
relations between the KMT
and CCP have been deadlocked.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.340
For the past half year,
you've been fighting alone,

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.620
openly against Liang Jingyuan,

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.820
and secretly against Gu Yangshan.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:54.820
You've suffered

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.940
but also gathered valuable experience.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.210
These two people
are both very calculating.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.580
Their alliance can't be simple.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.860
So I suspect

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:08.380
the two of them

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.690
will soon make their next move.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.210
We can't sit still and wait.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:13.210
We must strike first,

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:14.380
and kick Gu Yangshan out of the game.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.940
When can the code expert
sent by the Organization

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.140
to support me come?

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.690
The background checks at the institute

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:25.940
are now personally handled by Sasaki.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.210
The scrutiny is extremely strict.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.820
We have been preparing for months.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.490
The problem
of faking the expert's identity

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:31.820
was only just solved in recent days.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.580
Once you return,
find a chance to request

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.450
that you need a new secretarial officer.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.860
He will find a way
to be transferred to your side.

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.420
It's time to say goodbye.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.600
[Shanghai Army No. 2 Hospital]

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.380
Slow down.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.340
Careful, careful.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.380
Tell Xiao

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.690
the code replacement work
for the Pacification Committee's

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:28.620
secret radio

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.660
has been successfully completed
by Ding Yi.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:32.660
The expert we arranged for him

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.660
can be ready to enter
the institute at any time.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:35.940
Alright.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.580
But what about your side?

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.100
You're alone.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.620
If the data is correct,

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.620
this Dr. Edward

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.380
is the top cardiovascular surgeon today.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.340
For the patient on the top floor
to have the influence

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.140
to bring him here

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.420
shows he must be an important figure
in the Japanese army.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.690
I suspect it's Grand Duke Tonoji.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:31.820
But he's not the only person
in the Japanese army

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:33.970
who has cardiovascular disease.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.450
Why suspect only him?

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.530
Dr. Edward is British.

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:53.620
Given the tense relations
among Japan, the UK, and the US,

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:55.690
apart from Grand Duke Tonoji,

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.210
who served in Britain for years

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.620
and embraced Westernization,

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.580
who else would dare
to hire a British doctor

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.490
at such a critical time?

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.380
But,

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.100
according to the intelligence

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.490
we received some time ago,

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:12.660
Grand Duke is still recuperating
in Japan.

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:14.490
Last time Ding Yi mentioned

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.180
that the Cryptography Institute
had received

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.860
a coded message from a private radio.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:19.940
Do you remember?

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:20.620
I remember.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.490
Ding Yi told us
the frequency of that radio

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:25.450
and the time of transmission.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.580
After verification by higher-ups,

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.580
it turns out that
it was Sasaki's private radio.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.490
But what does that have to do

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:34.820
with who's living upstairs?

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.940
The Sasaki family is a representative

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.820
of the Imperial Way faction
in the military,

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:40.940
and an archenemy of the Tonoji family.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.580
Once our comrades
in the rear finish decrypting,

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.690
I believe the coded message
from that radio

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:50.690
will tell us

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.100
who the patient on the top floor

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.860
really is.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.730
Even if I have to get some gas now,

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.490
I still have to sign off, right?

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.340
Then what am I still
the Director of General Affairs?

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.140
Why don't you
let Xian Biyun take the job?

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:13.690
Signature.

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:15.250
Signature from a blind man?

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:16.450
Can he even see?

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:18.340
Liang.

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.940
The Pacification Committee
has been established.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.620
When are we moving there?

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.010
Stop reading.

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:27.140
Don't you know English-language
newspapers are contraband?

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:35.340
Others might not know, but you should.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.140
The title of
Pacification Committee member

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.490
is just an empty name.

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:40.860
Am I really looking at the newspaper?

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.450
I'm looking at my future.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.250
Nonsense.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.340
Someone's occupied our place.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.580
The living room's so small,
it's like a piece of tofu.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:52.730
You just had to be an official.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.730
And now look at where you've ended up.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:57.490
After all the effort we've spent,

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:00.100
you've even hurt your leg, but what for?

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.140
Alright.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.140
Don't touch me.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:15.580
Stop crying.

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:18.690
Do you think
I just want to be an official?

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:20.620
I'm trying to create

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.100
a sense of security for both of us.

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:26.100
You know perfectly well
what the situation is now.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:26.730
The both of us

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:29.290
are trying to survive here.

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:31.180
Everyone

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:33.820
goes through extremely difficult times.

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:36.490
Once you get through it,
things will be fine.

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:43.940
Was there something you wanted from me?

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.250
The Special Agent Headquarters
just called,

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.660
saying they're assigning
a new secretary to Joseph Lee.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.580
Did you know?

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:56.660
Is your information accurate?

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.420
They just called.

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:04.580
That's great.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:06.340
Don't say it.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.580
No one should talk about
using connections.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.490
Now we can't even talk about it?

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:09.580
If you had connections,
it could've be you.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.210
Seriously.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:17.250
Alright, I know.

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:19.970
Secretary Gu.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:29.900
Handle the onboarding formalities

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:30.940
for this new secretary quickly.

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:33.490
Then post his onboarding report

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:36.690
on the notice board in our institute.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.660
Due to heavy workload at the institute,

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:41.690
Director Lee's new secretary
will soon assume duty.

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.690
[Director Lee's new secretary will soon join]
Personnel changes are never announced.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:53.940
Times have changed.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.250
Not only will I announce it,

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:56.690
I'll make it in big red letters.

00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:59.690
I must let everyone in our institute

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:00.660
see it.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.940
What are you trying to do?

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:14.450
He broke one of my legs.

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:17.860
I'll break one of his arms.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.470
[Director Lee's new secretary
will soon join]

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:26.860
Last month, negotiations
among the Foreign Ministry,

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:28.940
the UK and US went very poorly.

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:32.660
So the Japanese have already
brought in specialists

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.900
to investigate pro-British
and pro-American forces

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.100
within the intelligence agencies.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.620
As for Joseph Lee,

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:40.140
his ties with Britain and America
are too deep.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.580
So once war breaks out,

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.420
he will definitely be cast aside.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.690
Ding Yi is just an informant.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.900
His role is to provide you cover.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.420
Once that cover fails,

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.580
casting him aside is inevitable.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.820
As long as you remain in the institute,

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.420
the Sword Thrust Operation goes on.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.420
I'm already planning

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.530
to use the Japanese purge
of British and American forces

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:02.450
as a pretext

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:05.690
to formally report Joseph Lee by name
for having overly close ties

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:06.580
with British and American personnel.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.820
This way,

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.860
Ding Yi will be
completely out of the game.

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.820
And I

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.420
will remain to continue my mission.

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:16.660
Hasn't Liang Jingyuan always
been trying to win you over?

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.420
He hates Joseph Lee to the core.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.660
You might as well sign

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.420
the letter of accusation he gave you

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.210
and let him be the one to hand it in.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.820
I will use Liang Jingyuan to do it,

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.100
but I will personally write this letter.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.510
[Joseph Lee]

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:42.660
I understand what you mean.

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.180
You just want

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.290
to control the wording of this letter

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.940
so Ding Yi can leave alive.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:54.900
But you know
what Liang Jingyuan is like.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.860
Do you think he won't figure it out?

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.140
If preserving Ding Yi

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.100
causes Liang Jingyuan
to lose trust in you...

Gu Yangshan,

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:07.660
I advise you to put
the bigger picture first,

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:10.100
and not act on emotion.

Luo Han, I understand what you mean.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.180
But you should know

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.580
that Ding Yi knows
our identities inside out.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.690
So if we push him too hard,

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.660
it will inevitably affect
our subsequent actions.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.690
So I have my own plans.

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:48.490

It seems I really
underestimated Liang Jingyuan.

he actually has some real power.

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:21.660
he used his wife
to trade for his future.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.610
He was furious after reading it.

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:33.820
I'm telling you,

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:36.820
Joseph Lee will definitely
be dead this time.

As long as he's finished this time,

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.530
you'll become the director
of the Cryptography Institute.

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:45.220

I know what you're thinking.

Your letter of accusation

00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:59.940
didn't really prove that Joseph Lee

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.420
secretly had ties
to Britain and America.

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:03.090
But it's not important.

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.090
What's important is that
this letter of accusation

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:10.260
serves as Joseph Lee's death warrant.

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:11.940
Mr. Lee,

If found to be false,
it is a serious crime.

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:27.260
According to Japanese wartime law,
it's punishable by death.

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:31.700
What do you mean?

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:33.220
Do you think Sasaki

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.050
went through all this trouble

00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:36.450
just to get rid of a blind man

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:37.940
who doesn't have much time left?

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:39.570
Of course not.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.420
We received a report

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.820
that you were intentionally monopolizing

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.300
code design work in the New Government.

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.490
Was this authorized by
the Tonoji family?

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.050
He wants to use Joseph Lee

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:55.090
to falsely accuse

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:57.050
the Tonoji family
of colluding with the enemy.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.420
That's nonsense.

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:01.220
This is completely unfounded.

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.420
I know nothing about it.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:04.780
Once this is done,

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:06.570
there will be no one left

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:09.650
to stand up to Tōjō Hideki.

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:14.260
Your father was the mathematics tutor

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.570
for the Grand Duke Tonoji

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:19.340
and often visited the Tonoji residence.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.490
At Grand Duke's residence,

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:26.490
which British personnel did you meet?

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.420
Grand Duke was personally appointed
by His Majesty the Emperor

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.900
as ambassador to the UK.

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:32.420
He has always been loyal to the Emperor.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:34.700
He has never had any contact

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.420
with British personnel outside of work,

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.700
let alone secretly inviting them

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:40.530

Lieutenant General Yasui,

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.940
you can doubt me,

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.380
but you absolutely
should not doubt Grand Duke.

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:56.490
Charlie,
you should consider yourself lucky.

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:58.300
You've offered this blade,

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.420

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.820
You have to think long term.

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:11.650
So I want to

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:15.740
thank you for this promotion,

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.450
for pulling me out of

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:19.490

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.700
Don't forget, we're friends.

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.900
Why say such things?

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.090
Sasaki and I both admire you.

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:34.420

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.780
Don't let everyone down.

is fully investigated,
