WEBVTT

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.440
Judge Qin.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.759
Why did your son...

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.200
go into Han Gang's hospital room?

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.720
He was even wearing a white coat.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.479
It was your car...

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.520
that hit Han Gang.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.199
Do you really think...

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.240
there's no connection?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Because the police...

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:27.160
found an asthma inhaler...

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.920
at the scene.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.680
It had your DNA on it.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.319
If they were to compare the DNA from the asthma inhaler...

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.080
to the vomit...

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.360
But...

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.800
my name isn't on the asthma inhaler.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.159
How did they know it was me?

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.800
Someone went through our trash this morning.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.400
In the trash,

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.519
there was your used asthma inhaler.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.720
Your DNA was in it.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.200
If they were to compare these three things,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.640
they could prove...

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.320
that you were at the scene.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.200
Luo Wen.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.920
Can I come in?

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.880
What's so important?

00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:17.000
I'm about to leave.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.640
Tang Xuan came to see me.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.480
I guess she's just like me.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.799
She already saw through the fact...

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.080
that you deliberately misled her.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.360
That's why she went to see you.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.880
She wants to convince you to testify against me.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.160
Are you worried?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.640
She told me with absolute certainty...

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.880
that Ma Shan Bao was not the culprit.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.480
She would find out the truth sooner or later.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.000
That the culprit is someone else.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.000
If today,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.720
I were acting as legal counsel,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.440
what do you think I should advise my client?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I think...

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.000
you shouldn't take this case.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.040
Luo Wen.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.160
You are very goal-oriented.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.040
You're a good lawyer.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.640
Thank you.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.360
I have to go.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.600
- Yi Wei. - Dad.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.199
Stay at home and wait for me.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.200
What happened?

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.280
I'll tell you when I get back.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.240
Dad.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.320
The police found out it was you.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.760
I guess they'll make a move soon.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.720
Han Kui Long has insiders in the police station.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.320
That's what I'm most worried about.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.920
If you get caught,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.920
you won't even make it to court.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.040
Do we really have to leave this time?

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.760
Yes, we have to.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.520
Okay.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.039
Pack your things as soon as you can.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.120
We're leaving on a plane tonight.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.840
- Okay. - Son.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.200
We might not come back again.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.240
Dad.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.240
Ma Shan Bao's death...

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.840
was it our fault?

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.640
It wasn't us.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.080
It was me.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.120
For this crime alone,

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.240
I'll be in jail for 10 years.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.840
I'm sorry.

00:03:45.841 --> 00:03:47.400
We're father and son. Don't say that.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.640
Go pack your things.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.640
(Justice is Mine)

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.640
(Episode 11)

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.120
What's wrong, Dad?

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.160
Someone is following us.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.560
He spotted me.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.720
- Hello? - Hello, Officer Hu.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.599
I need you to apply...

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.040
for an exit ban from the court.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.000
Who do you want to ban?

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.880
Qin Yu's son, Qin Yi Wei.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.560
Why?

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.400
I'll explain later.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.600
He's on his way to the airport.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.480
We must stop him before he leaves.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.680
Hey, come on.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.280
You're still on leave.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.200
If you get involved in this case again,

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.000
the Internal Investigations Unit will find out.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.960
There will be serious consequences.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.079
If we let him leave Hokong,

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.360
it will be too late.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.600
Trust me.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.959
I have concrete evidence...

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.960
to incriminate him.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.279
I've been with you for so many years.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.000
When have I ever accused anyone without cause?

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.200
Mr. Qi didn't say when he'd be back.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.040
If you keep this up,

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.840
you'll collapse before Mr. Qi returns.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.920
- Hello? - Judge Qin, where are you?

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.720
I couldn't find you at the courthouse.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.240
Do you need something from me?

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.640
Gosh,

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.200
it seems the saying,

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.960
"Fate plays tricks on people",

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.160
is true.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.719
If you have nothing to tell me...

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.960
If it's not important,

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.359
Chief Inspector Hu of the Regional Crime Unit...

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.840
wouldn't have come to see me.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.800
Get to the point.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.399
He came here...

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.640
to ask me to sign...

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.320
an exit ban.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.480
The person named in the ban is...

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.800
Qin Yi Wei.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.440
I don't remember your son's name,

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.040
but the address written on it...

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.080
is your current address.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.000
So, did you sign it?

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.200
Yes, I did.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.679
I was looking for you...

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.840
because I want you to understand...

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.560
that I'm just doing my job.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.120
I'm absolutely...

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.320
not trying to get back at you.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.120
Dad, are you alright?

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.520
No.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.920
I need to go out for a while.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.920
I'll be back in about two hours.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.639
Don't leave this room.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.920
Don't contact anyone, alright?

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.160
If you're hungry,

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.560
call for takeout.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.920
No, you'd better not call.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.320
I'll buy you some food later.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Dad.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Just listen to me.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.240
Don't leave this room.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.680
I'll be back soon, okay?

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.080
Yi Wei.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.920
We can get through this.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.000
You're my son.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.520
I won't leave you behind.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.600
I won't, no matter what happens.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.520
Okay?

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:22.640
Lock the door.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.799
We're all civilized people.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:56.840
Let's talk this out.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.640
Cancel that exit ban.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.520
Officer Hu said your son...

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.040
was involved in a hit-and-run.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.000
Inspector Tang and I had a misunderstanding.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.480
She didn't report it in time.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.520
Anyway, I'll explain it to them.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.320
Is that really the case?

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:12.960
Does Officer Hu have evidence?

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.600
He said he'd give it to me later.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.999
You signed the exit ban without evidence?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.080
That's against regulations.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.440
I can file a complaint against you.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.640
It's true that your son...

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.120
is going abroad.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.800
And it just so happens...

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.000
that it's when the police suspect him.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.720
Yes.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.360
My son has asthma.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.840
And it's getting worse.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.399
I've tried many methods,

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.119
seen many doctors, but nothing worked...

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.520
until I found this specialist.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.360
That's why I must go tonight.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.280
You have children too.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.880
As a parent, you should understand.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.360
If you use medical treatment as the reason,

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.799
the exit ban can be lifted.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.160
I won't do that.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.800
Didn't I make myself clear?

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.359
I expedited the process.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.320
However, it's not unprecedented.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.240
Assisting the police is the court's duty.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.839
As long as he provides...

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.959
the evidence later,

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.039
everything...

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.440
will be legal and reasonable.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.400
What if the evidence is insufficient?

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.640
That's not my responsibility.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.800
If my son's treatment is delayed,

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.440
causing his condition to deteriorate,

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.000
or even putting his life in danger,

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.680
you'll be held responsible.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.960
If I lodge a complaint,

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.319
you'll be known as...

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.080
the most ruthless and inhumane judge.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.520
Do you think you'll win the election...

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.920
for Chief Justice?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.480
Sometimes, investigating a case...

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.480
really depends on luck.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.520
But from a humane standpoint,

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.920
medical treatment is crucial.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.520
Thank you.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.000
Wei is missing.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.760
What?

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Are you sure?

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.600
They said Qi Chang Rong took Wei.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.840
I went to his house to look for him,

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.560
but he never came back.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.360
Hello?

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.599
Aren't you the most resourceful?

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.680
Say something!

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.759
You're the one who did this to Wei.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.360
You can't abandon him!

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.560
Where are you now?

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.799
I'm home. I was hoping for a miracle,

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.960
but it didn't happen.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.680
Wei didn't come back.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.240
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.400
Yi Wei.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.000
You can leave the country now.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.920
But I have something to take care of.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.280
Wait for me in the room.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.560
Hello, Yi Wei?

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.160
I heard you.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.879
She really waited for me all day and night.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.880
Yes.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.400
Change the battery. It's dead.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.080
Hello?

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.280
Qi Chang Rong.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.320
You finally picked up.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.240
My door is always open for you.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.039
I can't go to your house now.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.040
Let's talk outside.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.160
Where to?

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.240
Remember Dawang Temple?

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.680
Yes, we used to watch temple opera there when we were kids.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.359
- Back then, you were still... - Good that you remember.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.360
See you later.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.600
Who is it?

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.000
Wei Wei, it's Grandma.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.440
Wei Wei.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.320
Grandma, come in first.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.680
Wei Wei, you...

00:16:58.681 --> 00:17:00.240
Why did you come to a place like this?

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.280
What happened?

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.360
Grandma.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.480
I have something to tell you.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.480
Sha Sha.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.680
You must know why I'm looking for you.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.560
Why are your eyes puffy?

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:24.960
You cried?

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.280
I want to go in and offer incense.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.760
To pray for Wei's safety.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Okay.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.680
Mr. Qi,

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.720
there's no one inside.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
It's safe.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.439
Thick Snow, you two stay here.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.440
Okay.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.800
I want to ask you a question in front of the gods.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.280
Answer me honestly.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.719
You asked me to come here...

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.080
because you have something to ask me.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.360
Where is Wei?

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:22.720
He's safe.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.640
Then where is he?

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.040
Wei got into trouble.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.880
I arranged for him to flee.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.200
He's gone?

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.160
And he didn't tell me?

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.159
When he left, he asked me...

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.880
to take good care of you.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.200
He asked you to take care of me?

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.080
We're both from the Old City District.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.040
What's wrong with looking after each other?

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.479
You arranged for him to flee.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.480
Then where did he go?

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:02.760
Once he settles down,

00:19:02.761 --> 00:19:04.079
of course I'll tell you.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.400
That's all I can say.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.320
Then call him now.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:11.960
I want to talk to him.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.240
Now you care about him?

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.120
Didn't you take the kids to your parents' house?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.360
Wei is useless.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000
He got into trouble.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.600
He left you and ran away.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.080
That's it.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.560
Where is Wei?

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.440
Where is he?

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.680
She's his wife.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.120
- Shouldn't you ask her? - Where is he?

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.040
Do you know who you hit?

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.000
There aren't many people or vehicles on that road.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.880
I think it was a homeless person.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.439
But I don't know why.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.960
I didn't think of stopping at the time.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.360
Running away doesn't necessarily make you a bad person.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.679
Most of the time, it's instinct.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.800
Fear causes excessive panic,

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.199
especially for someone young like you.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.080
The court will take those factors into consideration.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.079
Why didn't your dad take you to turn yourself in?

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.080
He did.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:19.880
I just didn't dare.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.759
So everything he's doing now...

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:23.760
is for my sake.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.880
Where is he now?

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.960
Wei Wei.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.080
Living with all these secrets,

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.279
you'll suffocate yourself, you know?

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.280
I know.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.960
That's why I decided to turn myself in.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.480
I'm still a barrister.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.320
I'll definitely stay by your side.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.960
Where is it?

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.720
It's just around here.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.520
I'm asking you where it is.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.360
Every tree here looks pretty much the same.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.400
Where is it?

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.200
Over there. Over there!

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.040
Where?

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.800
Dig it up.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:42.840
Dig it up!

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.160
Wei!

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.680
Wei!

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.560
Wei.

00:22:30.561 --> 00:22:32.040
Wei.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.440
Wei.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.839
Hello, if you wish to leave a message,

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.159
please do so...

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.360
after the beep.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:46.880
Yi Wei.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.000
I'm on my way back.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.440
Are you alright?

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.160
Dad, I'm going to turn myself in.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.880
I'm sorry.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.440
Tang Xuan.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.360
Senior, do you have the result?

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.559
The DNA comparison test result you asked for is ready.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.039
- It's inside. - What's the result?

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.200
I think it's what you want.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.760
(Both DNA samples match the DNA on the tested object.)

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.360
Thank you.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.120
I owe you one.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.720
I'm Qin Yi Wei's father.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.720
Where is he?

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.360
He's inside giving his statement.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.960
Judge Qin, you can't go in.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.159
My son is giving his statement.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.160
I want to be with him.

00:25:44.161 --> 00:25:45.640
He already has a lawyer with him.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.480
- Who? - Ms. Shen Ning.

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.160
Mr. Qin Yi Wei,

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.360
please try to recall...

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.039
what happened during the accident...

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.320
and tell us in detail.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.440
I just got my driver's license.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.360
There were very few vehicles on the road that day.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.160
I wanted to try speeding up.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.560
But it seemed like a vehicle was going to overtake me.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.960
I was in the far-left slow lane.

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.720
All my attention was on the right.

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.320
I didn't know he would overtake me from the left.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:26.760
In the end, I hit...

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
I hit him.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.680
Wei Wei.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.799
Didn't you say you hit a homeless man?

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.440
How did it become a vehicle accident?

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:41.840
I was mistaken.

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:43.880
After the accident,

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.280
besides Ms. Shen,

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.560
did you tell anyone else?

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.360
No.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.520
I... I drove the car home...

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.720
right after that.

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.160
Then I hid in my room.

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.120
I didn't tell anyone.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.920
Not even my dad.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.960
Let me repeat what you said.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:07.880
You're a probationary driver.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.280
That day, you were driving in the left lane.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.160
Then a vehicle behind you suddenly sped up and overtook you.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.280
You were scared.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.840
When the vehicle overtook you,

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.320
the two vehicles collided.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.479
Because you were scared,

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.559
you didn't stop.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:21.760
You drove straight home.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.160
When you got home, you didn't tell anyone.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.040
Later, the car was stolen.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.480
This is your statement.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.600
Is there any problem with it?

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.959
So after the accident,

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.000
you just drove off?

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.960
I didn't know what to do then.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.160
Did you get out of the car?

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.000
Did you try to approach the victim?

00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:59.600
No.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:03.920
Do you remember...

00:28:03.921 --> 00:28:04.960
what kind of vehicle you hit?

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.120
A motorcycle.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.960
Checking the records,

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.319
there was only one traffic accident that day.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.599
A private car...

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:17.720
collided with a motorcycle.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.679
The private car driver committed a hit-and-run.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.640
The motorcyclist was unconscious and seriously injured.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.240
The victim is not homeless,

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.399
but part of the Han family,

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.479
Han Kui Long's son,

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.480
Han Gang.

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:28.920
Stop. Time out.

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.839
I need to talk to my client.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.320
Don't ask any more questions.

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.120
Judge Qin.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.280
I heard your son turned himself in.

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.320
I'm the one who applied for the exit ban.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:04.760
I know.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.760
And you're also the one who followed me.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.560
I always thought...

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.440
you were the wisest person among everyone I knew.

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.559
I didn't think you'd do...

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:16.680
something so foolish.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.720
This is...

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.760
the DNA test result.

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:23.919
The saliva sample...

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.920
from the asthma inhaler found at the accident scene...

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.159
and the DNA of the suspect...

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.320
I've been investigating recently...

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:29.960
are a perfect match.

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.520
Let me tell you.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.759
If your evidence collection process...

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.840
was unlawful,

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.520
including stealing my trash,

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.760
it cannot be used as evidence.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.920
Judge Qin truly lives up to his name.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.760
Since the suspect has turned himself in,

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:46.879
I'll apply to take a new sample...

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.320
and for a re-test.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.320
The result will be the same.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.440
Wei Wei.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.840
Why did you lie to Grandma?

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.559
I was afraid that if you knew who I hit,

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.120
you'd stop me from turning myself in.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.840
I really want to get it off my chest.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.240
I don't want to drag anyone else into this.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.120
I... I don't need a lawyer to represent me.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.720
I just want to take responsibility myself.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:42.960
I understand.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.560
You're all grown up now.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.440
You can make your own decisions.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:48.960
But Grandma will be by your side.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.080
I will protect your interests...

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.720
within the bounds of the law.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.720
Don't be afraid.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.040
Okay.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.160
Let's resume.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.720
Continue.

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:14.920
Yi Wei.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.920
- Yi Wei! - Judge Qin, you can't do this.

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.040
Let them talk.

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.040
Just let him talk.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.600
Son.

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.319
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.320
Dad's here.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.360
Dad.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.400
I told them what happened that day.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.760
It's all my responsibility.

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.360
It has nothing to do with you.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.960
What are you charging him with?

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.239
Qin Yi Wei has violated traffic laws...

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.400
and is guilty of evading responsibility.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.720
We have officially arrested him.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.560
I want to bail him out.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.040
Did you apply for bail?

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.519
Do you think I don't know?

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.560
It was rejected.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.560
Considering the risk of flight,

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.600
he can't be bailed out...

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.120
for the time being.

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.000
We will detain...

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.040
the suspect directly in the detention center.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.160
Take him away.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:07.360
Yes, sir.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.080
Don't be afraid.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.160
Dad will think of a way.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:11.520
Trust me.

00:32:11.521 --> 00:32:13.120
Trust me. Don't be afraid.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.200
Trust me.

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.600
Let's go.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.080
I have something to ask you.

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:33.960
Let's talk when we get home.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:49.520
Tang Xuan.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.759
Didn't I tell you...

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:56.760
not to get involved...

00:32:56.761 --> 00:32:59.120
in this case while you're on leave?

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.759
But didn't you help me get an exit ban?

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.240
I gathered intel and took action.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.919
But you used your police authority...

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.080
without permission.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.119
Do you think the Internal Investigations Unit...

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:11.279
doesn't have enough evidence to charge you,

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.880
so you're handing yourself over?

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.440
Yes.

00:33:15.441 --> 00:33:16.560
It's my fault.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.160
But finding the real culprit is worth it.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.680
Okay.

00:33:21.681 --> 00:33:23.000
When the case is over,

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.559
I think the Internal Investigations Unit...

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:25.560
will see that you're capable...

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:26.640
and that you solved the case,

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.760
so they won't keep going after you.

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.440
The case won't be over so soon.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.559
Judge Qin has been misleading me.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.760
Don't cause any more trouble, okay?

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.759
Didn't his son already say...

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.920
his dad didn't know anything?

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.479
Also, you don't have any evidence...

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.519
that Qin Yu was involved.

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:43.520
If you reinstate me,

00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:44.920
I'll be able to find the evidence.

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.200
Anyway, I've been in charge of this case all along.

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.360
Okay. I'll let you investigate.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:52.879
But you have to promise me...

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.400
not to target Qin Yu anymore.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.359
I don't want others...

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.079
to think you have ulterior motives.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.080
Do you understand?

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.240
I won't let him off that easily.

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.880
Did you tell Yi Wei to turn himself in?

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.080
That's what I want to ask you.

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.119
Did you teach Yi Wei...

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.360
to hide, lie, and deceive me?

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.160
He hit Han Kui Long's son.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.640
Do you think if he's sentenced to prison,

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.720
he'll have any chance of making it out alive?

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.440
He came to me.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.160
He regrets it and blames himself.

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:30.640
He wants to take responsibility for his mistake.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.040
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.680
Isn't that the right thing to do?

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:36.520
Before this,

00:34:36.521 --> 00:34:38.279
all those abnormal behaviors of yours,

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.240
I finally have a reasonable explanation.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.440
Let me ask you one more thing.

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.760
You'd better be honest with me.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.560
While covering up for Wei Wei,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.800
did you do anything illegal?

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.360
Have you ever implicated innocent people?

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.760
I've canceled my leave.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.640
I'm back in charge of this case.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.240
You didn't ask me to come to the police station.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.760
That means this is...

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.120
an informal conversation.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.640
I just want to clarify a few facts.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.960
It won't affect the direction of the investigation.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.720
It's also fairer for your son.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.320
You don't object, right?

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.080
That day,

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.439
you insisted that Ma Shan Bao...

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.560
was the one who stole the car.

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.040
But now,

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.960
your son turned himself in.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.160
He said he was the one who hit Han Gang.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Can you explain?

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:45.840
Yes.

00:37:45.841 --> 00:37:46.920
Then listen carefully.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.880
That day, I told you...

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.399
I found Ma Shan Bao...

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.560
near my house.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.080
It was the police who identified Ma Shan Bao...

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.320
as the car thief.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.320
It has nothing to do with me.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:57.600
Are you satisfied...

00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.720
with this answer?

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.279
I showed you the CCTV photos...

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.040
of Qin Yi Wei at the hospital.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.400
You promised me...

00:38:03.401 --> 00:38:04.960
you'd bring him in for questioning.

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:06.560
But not long after that,

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.160
I was reported...

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.560
for an internal investigation.

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.560
The night I asked Han Lie to meet,

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:12.760
you also asked to meet me.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.040
You told me...

00:38:14.041 --> 00:38:15.240
you were already in my neighborhood.

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:16.879
So the person most likely...

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.080
to have seen me meeting with Han Lie...

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:19.680
was you.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.359
But the one who reported me...

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.720
was Ms. Zhou Luo Wen.

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.240
Do you really not know anything about all this?

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.480
Was it really just a coincidence?

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.080
The complaint mechanism...

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:37.320
keeps the identity of whistleblowers...

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:38.680
strictly confidential.

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:41.320
You shouldn't have disclosed it to a third party.

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:43.559
As a judge,

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.840
I can't just sit back and do nothing.

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.880
But since this is an informal conversation,

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.720
I can pretend...

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.280
I didn't hear what you just said.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.240
But I have to remind you.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.080
Breaching confidentiality...

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.920
is a disciplinary offense.

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:00.000
Qin Yi Wei's statement...

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.639
clearly stated...

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.320
the time and place of the accident.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.000
But that night,

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.639
you personally came to the police station...

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.680
and reported the car stolen.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.360
According to the records,

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:11.879
you said the car...

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.560
was stolen around 10am.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.319
How do you know...

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.800
the car was stolen at 10am?

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.920
What I want to know is,

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.120
what's the difference...

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.560
between what you said and the statement...

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.040
your son Qin Yi Wei provided?

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.520
I am related to him.

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:29.160
Unless you voluntarily disclose his statement...

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.520
to show me...

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.680
that he gave it without being misled,

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.560
I will invoke immunity...

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.080
to avoid making any statement detrimental to him.

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:41.560
Judge Qin is truly formidable.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:43.880
Thank you for cooperating with me.

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.160
This isn't over yet.

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.520
I'll be back.

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:57.920
(Qin Yu - Qin Yi Wei)

00:39:57.921 --> 00:39:59.999
(August 21: Received a bomb cake) (The day the car went missing)

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.080
(Alibi)

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.360
Hello, darkness, my dear old friend

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:19.360
I've come to talk with you again

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:26.240
Because a vision softly creeping

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:31.520
Left its seeds while I was sleeping

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:39.480
And the vision that was planted in my brain

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.680
Still remains

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:50.200
Within the sound of silence

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000
That was beautiful.

00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.719
I hope you don't mind.

00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.840
I haven't played in a long time.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:01.560
I just wanted to...

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:03.040
use this song...

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.280
to wish you success in the case.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.480
The culprit has been caught, but...

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:12.360
the accomplice is still at large.

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.639
Judge Qin is a judge.

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:16.440
He has always been a good judge.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:17.920
Don't forget,

00:41:17.921 --> 00:41:19.320
you used to trust him a lot.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.839
You even got your hand injured...

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.160
while protecting him.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.440
That doesn't mean he can knowingly break the law.

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:26.960
He didn't break the law.

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.959
He merely took advantage of factors...

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.439
favorable to him...

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.640
during the legal process.

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:34.360
That was smart.

00:41:34.361 --> 00:41:35.400
Being smart isn't a crime.

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.480
He implicated innocent people.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.360
The court judges...

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:42.760
based on evidence.

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:45.400
It can't judge morality or conscience.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.759
Why do you keep defending him?

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.240
I admire him.

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:53.120
But I hope you won't be so stubborn.

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.440
Enough about me.

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:57.640
Let's talk about you.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.959
Any new developments...

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:00.960
on Liu Mao?

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.760
I've been in touch with him.

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.199
He's now hesitating about...

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:09.760
whether to have the surgery.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.759
You said he has terminal cancer.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.559
So is it possible that...

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:15.560
Yes.

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:17.440
That's why it's really hard...

00:42:17.441 --> 00:42:19.040
to talk to him about anything else right now.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:22.359
If you lose this lead too...

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.359
Hey, let's stop talking about all this.

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.480
Let's get down to business.

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:26.920
I hope you can learn this song.

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.199
This song has two parts.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.200
If you learn it,

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.160
I can sing backup for you.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:33.600
Isn't it romantic?

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:35.920
Me?

00:42:35.921 --> 00:42:37.800
- Yes. - It'll take a long time.

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:39.719
It doesn't matter how long.

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.080
Just give it a try.

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:42.480
Try it.

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:43.800
There's something in here.

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.680
Do you hear something?

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:48.519
- Help me see what it is. - Oh, really?

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:49.880
I paid 10,000 for this guitar.

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:51.359
Not bad. Take your time.

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.880
- No, help me take a look. - I'll tidy up my things.

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:54.520
Hey.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.200
You're here.

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.240
- Thank you. - Here.

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:30.160
Mother.

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:32.280
I want to tell you something.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:35.520
Now that things have come to this point,

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:37.720
my roles as a father...

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.200
and as a judge...

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.040
have overlapped.

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.560
But in both roles,

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.160
I made the decision...

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.680
to protect Yi Wei.

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.400
So I hope...

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:50.920
you won't ask certain things.

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.280
Right now, you and I...

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.160
are Yi Wei's only family.

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:57.920
If I don't get your cooperation,

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:00.240
it will be hard to help him.

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:04.400
As long as it's for Yi Wei's good,

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:05.960
I'll cooperate with you on anything.

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.400
Okay.

00:44:09.401 --> 00:44:10.480
Wait a minute.

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.280
Where did you find it?

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:20.440
I didn't find it.

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.160
Wei Wei found it.

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:24.320
Yi Wei?

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:48.560
Luo Wen.

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:49.880
Do you need something from me?

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:51.960
I heard the news.

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.280
Your son turned himself in.

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:56.080
What about you?

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.359
Doesn't everyone have to pay...

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:01.840
for their wrongdoings?

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.440
Why are you exempt?

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:07.120
Is it all...

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:09.800
because you're a judge?

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:12.840
I trusted you blindly.

00:45:12.841 --> 00:45:14.160
I have to pay the price too.

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:17.440
I'll stop taking cases.

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:19.080
I'll leave here.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:21.880
I'll reflect on myself...

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.160
and on what I should do from now on.

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:25.680
Luo Wen,

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000
you don't have to do this.

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:30.920
Justice...

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.560
is the core of the rule of law.

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:36.560
The rule of law...

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.760
is the foundation for maintaining social order and stability.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.279
It guarantees the rights and freedom...

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.280
of every one of us.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.160
It protects us...

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:49.960
from violence and oppression.

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:52.760
It's the embodiment of fairness,

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.400
impartiality,

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.400
and equality.

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.840
It's the moral standard of our society!

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.360
You taught me all these things.

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.160
I hope you can teach yourself too.

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:19.000
Think about it carefully.

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.160
Do you still deserve to be a judge?
