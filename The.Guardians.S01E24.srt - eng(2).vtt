[The Guardians]

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.920
[Episode 24]

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.180
You were out of
the institute all day today.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.020
Don't tell me

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.900
you went to a brothel in broad daylight.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.180
I do have reasons I can't speak of.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.660
I had a craving for opium.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.260
I slipped back to have a few puffs.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.060
Really?

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.220
Yeah.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.820
But that's not what Joseph Lee said.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.130
He said you came back to send a message.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.340
He's slandering me.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.270
He...

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.820
If he says that,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.260
I could also say
he came to send a message.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.100
How can a blind man send messages?

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.500
Sorry, sorry.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.780
Sorry, sorry.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.820
I forgot, I forgot.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.610
He still has Charlie.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.260
Right?

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.660
Yes, he has Charlie.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.260
Yes, Charlie.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.820
I saw Charlie.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.260
It was Charlie who sent the message.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.540
Do you have proof?

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.380
No.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.380
You don't.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.260
No evidence.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.380
Without it, I can't help you.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.660
Joseph Lee has no evidence too,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.940
yet he can frame me.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.260
Evidence, evidence.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.500
Evidence, evidence.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.660
Let me think.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.290
Evidence.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.980
Evidence.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.610
Evidence.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.100
Let me think.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.940
Evidence.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.010
The radio.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.220
The radio.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.060
The radio is the evidence.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.820
Whoever holds the radio
is the Communist spy.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.660
I know.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:37.820
Yi Aida.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.540
Yi Aida and

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.610
her father,

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.820
Yi Xiuyuan.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.380
They are the Communist spies.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.540
That Yi Xiuyuan

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.570
hides in the institute

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.660
every day,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.100
with a cold face, ignoring everyone.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.380
So sneaky.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.500
Does he know Yi Aida is dead?

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.290
Arrest him, don't let him run!

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.340
I told you before.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.220
It's not them.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.290
Not them?

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.540
Then it's...

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.500
Dong Jinbo and Liu Fangbai?

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.380
Although you sent them
on a secret mission,

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.380
maybe

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.980
they secretly sneaked back to Sanyangli

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.100
and sent messages for the Communists.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.980
Director Liang.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.940
Huan.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.580
I want to expose you.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.980
Shen Wanqing is the Communist spy.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.660
Huan.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.050
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.730
In the evening,

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.980
my brother helped him clean his car.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.700
There was blood in his car.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.340
My brother was bewitched by him

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.980
and died protecting him.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.020
It's you who killed my brother!

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.340
Huan, what's wrong with you?
What's wrong?

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.020
Are you out of your mind?

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.780
I'm your master.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.980
Director Liang, don't listen to her.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.340
She must be upset because

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.580
her brother died.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.580
Huan, Huan.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.700
Don't touch me!

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.700
You murderer!

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.170
He stored something

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.050
in the Continental Bank.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.460
Li Huan!

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.220
The Biography of Loyal Heroes.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.340
I stored it for him.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.540
He thought I was young and naive.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.700
At the time, I thought

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.140
what's so special
about keeping an old book?

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.220
So I secretly took a look.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.140
Inside, there was

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.370
a photo

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.340
about the decoded Xige Code.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.020
Director Liang, I really don't know
anything about that book.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.220
I just stole a little bit of
the Xige Code's material.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.780
I wanted to sell it on the black market

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.140
and make some money.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.020
That was all Kuomintang stuff.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.020
It wouldn't cause any loss
to the New Government.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.780
As for the New Government's things,

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.050
I haven't taken even the tiniest bit.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.660
Really.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.980
Li Huan,
why would you make up this stuff

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.460
to frame me?

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.140
This could get me killed!

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.700
Mr. Shen, please.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.780
Director Liang.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.020
Sit.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.340
Director Liang.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.220
Don't listen to her, Director Liang.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.340
She...she's crazy.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.140
Li Huan, are you sure?

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.340
Amu, go to the Continental Bank

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.220
and get me that book she mentioned.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.220
Continental Bank
only goes by the account holder's face.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.700
That's fine. Take two more people.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.900
Bring Miss Li along.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.220
Wait.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.020
Since you've already
severed ties with your master,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.140
there's no need to
wear his clothes anymore.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.850
Return it to him.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.900
What you've given me,
I'll return twofold!

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.220
Ungrateful traitor!

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.460
Everything she said is false.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.540
She's framing me.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.700
Director Liang, Director Liang.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.700
Director Liang.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.340
Director Liang, I didn't.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.340
I really...

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.460
Do you drink coffee?

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.140
No.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.540
Director Liang.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.780
Who would you sell the material to?

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.460
The Communists?

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.780
I didn't intend to
sell it to the Communists.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.980
Even if I did sell it to the Communists,

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.580
you still can't call me a Communist spy.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.980
As for the Xige Code's matter,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.490
we can put it aside for now.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.100
If that Biography of Loyal Heroes

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.770
is really in that safe,

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.220
then you can't escape your identity
as a Communist spy.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.820
Director Liang, I was wrong.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.220
I was wrong.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.460
I won't dare again.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.220
Director Liang, spare me.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.340
I was really wrong.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.340
Director Liang, I won't dare again.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.700
There won't be a next time.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.940
Director Liang.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.820
Director Liang, please spare me.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.580
Director Liang!

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:05.250
I...

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.580
Thank you, Master.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.180
It's chocolate.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.060
Is it sweet?

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.460
Very sweet.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.580
Thank you, Master.

Remember what I told you.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.580
If one day something happens to me,

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.580
then tell them about the thing I hid

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.770
in the Continental Bank.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.100
It will save your life.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.580
Do you still remember

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.340
what I told you?

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.580
You must listen to me.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:37.980
Put it on.

[Li Huan will take it out]

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.340
Mr. Shen is right.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.140
Li Huan.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.380
You must live well.

Chaosheng Troupe, find Wu.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:05.860
Director Liang!

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:07.410
Something's wrong, Director Liang.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:08.740
Li Huan has escaped.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.260
Director Liang.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.860
Li Huan suddenly attacked us.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.650
The car lost control
and overturned into the river.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:15.890
Li Huan is a strong swimmer.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.020
Captain Amu
took another man to catch her.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:18.860
Useless!

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.620
Li Huan has escaped?

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.340
Director Liang,
what a lousy job you've done.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.170
At this point,

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:31.170
I don't think
we need to say anything more.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.500
Director Liang,
you should know very well

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.220
that once Li Huan escapes,

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.500
it confirms her identity
as a Communist spy.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.860
What you should be doing now

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.500
is requesting the Colonel to authorize
a citywide manhunt for Li Huan

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.340
and lift the blockade on Sanyangli,

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.340
instead of wasting time

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.020
pointlessly on us.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.740
Charlie, I think
we should be able to leave now.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:50.860
Yes, Mr. Lee.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.500
Do you think I'm a fool, Joseph Lee?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.620
The Communist spy is among you.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.500
Today I will definitely expose you!

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.620
Close the door!

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.980
Enough, Liang Jingyuan!

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.620
What on earth are you trying to do?

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.980
Earlier, when the radio
was in Yi Aida's hands,

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.860
you said she wasn't a spy

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.100
just because you believed her.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:21.980
Now Li Huan has escaped too.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:22.860
Give me an explanation.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.380
If neither of them are spies,

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.290
then who exactly is?

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.690
It's you!

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.100
Joseph Lee, you're a Communist.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.740
I saw you instructing Charlie
to send the message!

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.980
You're the Communist spy.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.860
I saw it. You're the Communist spy!

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:46.360
[Betray me]

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:50.340
I saw it. You're the Communist spy!

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.500
Shen Wanqing, I have no enmity with you.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.220
Why are you framing me?

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.740
Director Liang said

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.740
the Communist spy is between you and me.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.100
If it's not me, it must be you.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.340
Can you take responsibility
for what you said?

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.980
It was you who framed me first.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:32.500
Even my disciple turned against me.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.500
Not to mention you, a blind man

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.500
who came out of nowhere.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.100
Director Liang,
I have something to report.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.500
I know something

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.620
that can confirm
Shen Wanqing is a Communist spy.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.500
Today at around six o'clock,

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.220
I was resting in bed

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.980
when the desk lamp started flickering

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.500
for a few minutes and then stopped.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.860
Sanyangli's electrical circuit

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.100
has always been in an aging state

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.740
and cannot handle
a high-powered radio transmission.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.220
But the one sharing a circuit
with Mr. Lee's

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:07.740
is Shen Wanqing.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.500
So I suspect that at that time,

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.020
Shen Wanqing was sending a telegram.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.020
Nonsense.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.980
What do you mean nonsense?

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.260
Power supply here
has always been problematic.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.500
Unstable circuits are common.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.860
But at exactly six o'clock?

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.100
That's too much of a coincidence.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.260
Fine, I also have a report.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.500
Director Liang, before you told me

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.980
that the Bai Ye you were looking for
had stomach trouble.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.100
Shen Wanqing has stomach trouble.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.340
He has a serious stomach problem.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.500
He is that Bai Ye.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.980
Earlier, in the lab restroom,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.980
I heard him vomiting.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.140
He must have used some method

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.620
to get through the physical examination.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.570
That's right, Mr. Lee.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:50.620
It was laudanum.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.100
Director Liang, it was opium paste
and strong liquor

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.340
mixed into a powerful painkiller.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.620
He must have drunk that

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.140
to mask his stomach pains.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.980
Once we brushed past
each other going downstairs,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.620
and he had this pungent smell on him.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.410
It was exactly the smell of laudanum.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:05.500
It must be him.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.690
Nonsense, both of you.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.860
Mr. Lee, please calm down.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.740
What else do you have to say?

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.620
I'll fight you both!

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.840
[Pouring out my heart and soul]

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.090
Mr. Lee, Mr. Lee...

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.700
Director Liang, save Mr. Lee!

00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:00.080
[Sacrificing myself
to save others in peril]

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.220
Shen Wanqing!

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.980
Mr. Lee's about to be strangled,
Director Liang!

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:07.980
Shut up.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.530
What are you trying to do?

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:12.460
Dead.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.220
I want you dead!

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.700
Liang Jingyuan.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.900
Help me!

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.460
Help me!

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.960
[Farewell, comrade]

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.420
Help him!

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.900
Let me go!

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.140
Who told you to fire?

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.010
Mr. Liang.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:45.980
Mr. Liang.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.220
You promised me.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.900
And the result?

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.140
The Communist spy Bai Ye
has been executed.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.660
So all I got was a corpse?

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.980
Didn't you say that capturing him

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.730
would lead us to the CCP
Shanghai underground network?

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.700
The Continental Bank has their evidence.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.900
It's already been verified.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.220
The item has already

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.900
been taken by his comrades.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.460
Mr. Lee.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.460
You've worked hard tonight.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.620
I heard Mrs. Lee is still
in the hospital.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.860
We will definitely do our best
to treat her.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.420
Mr. Lee.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.460
Let's go to the hospital.

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:22.140
Director Liang.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.140
Mr. Lee.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.860
Calm down.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.900
What are you doing?

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.140
Then you should ask

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.980
what Director Liang was doing just now!

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:32.900
Liang Jingyuan.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.770
Liang Jingyuan.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:38.220
You harbor malicious intentions.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.010
You wanted to use the Communist spy
to get rid of me.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.620
I originally thought you were
just dissatisfied with my work.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:44.620
I didn't expect

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.140
you actually wanted to eliminate me.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.980
Colonel, Colonel.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:53.980
Colonel.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.140
As Grand Duke Tonoji's adopted son,

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.900
I was unjustly framed by this man.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.980
I don't know
if this was his personal act

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.460
or if someone gave him orders

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.220
and granted him such power.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.140
Or perhaps,

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.220
this was your intention, Colonel.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.700
This is simply a direct challenge

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.980
to the entire Tonoji family

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.220
and an immense insult
to the Japanese Imperial family!

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.420
I'm sorry, Mr. Lee.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.460
It's my incompetence

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.620
that has allowed the situation
to escalate to this point.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.900
On behalf of the Japanese military,

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.620
I apologize to you.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.900
In his current state,

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.980
Liang Jingyuan can no longer
handle the institute's affairs.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:45.860
Mr. Lee,

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.010
as the pillar of
the Cryptography Institute,

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:51.220
please take over all the affairs

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.980
of the institute.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:55.620
Mr. Lee.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:57.460
From now on,

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.250
you are the director
of the Cryptography Institute.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:13.940
Also,

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.730
collect all items
related to the Communist spy.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.420
Take them back to
the military police to be sealed.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.220
Send the body to the Army Hospital.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.140
Army Hospital.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:25.420
Mr. Shen, you went out this afternoon?

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.220
Director Lee, don't ask.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.420
It's fine if you won't give me a ride,

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:37.860
but you got angry.

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.860
How does it feel here?

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:56.980
Does it hurt here?

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:05.620
Are you alright, Master?

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.460
Wipe it clean.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.640
[Pouring out my heart and soul]

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:50.920
[Sacrificing myself
to save others in peril]

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.980
Help me!

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.850
Order of the 33rd Division of
the Kuomintang

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:42.130
to attack Huangqiao.

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:45.420
They decided to continue
the attack the enemy at dawn today

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:48.500
and occupy Huangqiao.

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:52.090
Corps Commander, Sun Qiren.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.260
Earlier you told me

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.700
that after finding him

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.530
we would leave.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.660
Now I'm not leaving.

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.050
He used his own life

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.660
to teach me

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.660
the working methods
of a Communist Party member.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.420
I want to know the mission
he had afterwards.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.260
Please allow me to complete it for him.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.740
I want to become Bai Ye.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.460
My master is gone.

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.500
My brother is gone too.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.650
Uncle Wu said
he would take me to Yan'an.

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:18.690
Actually, my master

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.940
had long foreseen this day.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.860
So he told me in advance

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.500
the way for my brother and me to escape.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.820
He told me to expose to Liang Jingyuan

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.420
the staff in the Continental Bank
that could prove

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.610
he was a Communist spy.

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:33.460
Director Liang.

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:35.380
Huan.

00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:37.900
I have something to report.

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.020
Shen Wanqing is the Communist spy.

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:44.500
This way,
even if his identity was exposed,

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.090
my brother and I could still be safe.

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:52.900
At that time,

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.820
I already knew he was prepared to die.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.570
I just didn't expect
that day to come so soon.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.650
I didn't even get to
see them one last time.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.650
That night, Master told me

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:18.860
the intelligence to be delivered
was inside his coat.

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:21.420
I knew I had to

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.860
betray my master

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.420
to get the information out.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.020
Originally, I thought that
as long as I got out successfully

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.090
and retrieved the item
from the Continental Bank,

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.860
you and Master
could pin Bai Ye's identity

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.020
onto me.

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:40.820
But I didn't expect

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.980
I still couldn't get the coat out.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.980
That's why Master
had to take such a tragic course.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.530
I knew you were a good child.

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.500
Nothing more needs to be said.

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.050
Take good care of your brother.

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:01.170
His head is filled with math.
He's a bit of a fool.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.690
If one day I'm no longer around,

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:09.460
don't be afraid.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.820
Live bravely.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.020
Keep your eyes wide open

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:21.050
and help me to see

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:24.090
the new world.

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:44.940
In fact, from the moment
my brother and I

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.340
started following Master,

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:50.530
we knew exactly what path he had chosen.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.610
The victory at the Battle of Huangqiao

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:06.690
resolved the biggest issue.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.500
The Eighth Route Army
and the New Fourth Army,

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:09.900
China's two most progressive forces

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.780
that are most resolute in warfare

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.090
and most thorough in revolution,
have united.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.050
They could now coordinate much better

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:18.340
and develop further.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.940

the anti-Japanese democratic bases

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:24.340
and that in northern China.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:25.690
Not only did it lay

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:28.130
the foundation for the anti-Japanese
democratic base in northern Jiangsu,

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.420
it also gave the revolutionary
forces in central China

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:32.460
their first advantage,

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:34.050
increasing

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:36.980
the favorable conditions
for China's revolutionary victory.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:50.900
I swear.

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:53.170
I swear.

Adhere to the Party's discipline.

For the cause of communism.

Then, travel ten thousand miles.

I've already decided my path.

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.820
I'll join the army, and
walk the path my father walked.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.210
You should walk your own path.

And what is that?

and complete the mission
the Party gave him?

the hardest was
stepping from audience to stage.

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.980
Now I know

the hardest thing

is going from the spotlight
to the shadows.

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.050
they did not sacrifice for nothing.

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:55.090
I will be like them,

The Xige Code is no longer safe.
